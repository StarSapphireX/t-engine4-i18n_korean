t([[(You see here a pile of strange tablets, all piled up in a nice, orderly stack.  You remove the top one, and study it; your finger slips across a square in one corner, and strange sentences start playing through your mind. You struggle to make sense of the unfamiliar words and concepts in your thoughts.)

Many #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[moon-craters]#{normal}##LAST# after he #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted]#{normal}##LAST# us and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[retired]#{normal}##LAST#, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# awoke from his #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cocoon]#{normal}##LAST# to see us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattling]#{normal}##LAST#. He was shocked at our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[wilted]#{normal}##LAST# state, asking us why we #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattled]#{normal}##LAST#; we told him about the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shaking]#{normal}##LAST# we had to suffer through, the way the planet was #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[jammed up]#{normal}##LAST# and how although our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peas in a pod]#{normal}##LAST# had #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[plugged the leaks]#{normal}##LAST# to keep the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# from #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[falling out]#{normal}##LAST#, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[brooms]#{normal}##LAST# kept sweeping our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[dust bunnies]#{normal}##LAST# away, and there wasn't enough empty room to keep the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# from #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cracking]#{normal}##LAST#.

(There is a larger square on the tablet here; you press your hand to it, and suddenly you see a desert planet, ravaged by constant dust-storms. You feel the futility of a short, greenish thing as he looks on his ruined crops; you feel the wrath of a red-skinned humanoid as he rushes at a large horde of small, onyx creatures, a sword in one hand and a fireball in the other. The images disappear as you remove your hand.)

#{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# gave us his #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST#, and after we #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tripped the janitors?]#{normal}##LAST# he had us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shake gently?]#{normal}##LAST#, but instead of #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattling]#{normal}##LAST# we were #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[making music]#{normal}##LAST#, only #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cracking]#{normal}##LAST# the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# that made us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[out of tune]#{normal}##LAST#; our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# grew stronger, learned how to use #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST# of different #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[colors]#{normal}##LAST# than what the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# gave us. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# loved to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hear our music]#{normal}##LAST#, and we were grateful he was there to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[compose]#{normal}##LAST# for us when we needed; soon we were #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[writing our own music]#{normal}##LAST# and didn't need to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattle]#{normal}##LAST# anymore, and the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[retired]#{normal}##LAST#.

(Another larger square. You see a wonderful, loving #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# descending on the planet, desert turning to lush forest with his touch; you worship him with your green and onyx and ruby brethren, all different shapes and sizes, united for the first time in appreciating all the good he's done for you. For the first time in ages, you know where your next meal is coming from, and you need not fear others killing you for your farmland, nor the dust storms. He holds the corpses of some reclusive earth-mages in his hand, the source of the storms; you would be angry at them, but you can only feel happiness for the future to come. You and your brethren start competing in an organized fashion, occasionally in fights again, but even when you die you know it's for the good of the planet; an age later, you and your brethren are smarter, stronger, and far happier than before, living in paradise. You remove your hand an instant later, and the feelings of worship and admiration drain from you.)

Eventually, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# came. We tried to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[crack their beads]#{normal}##LAST# but nothing happened; they did not try to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[crack]#{normal}##LAST# us but instead promised us even more wonderful #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[sheet music]#{normal}##LAST# than what our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# had given us, under the condition that we let them #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shatter]#{normal}##LAST# him. We refused, but we reached a #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[nasty pod]#{normal}##LAST# together; we'd #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[mute? pot?]#{normal}##LAST# the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# with the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST# he gave us, leaving him a #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[lazy carpenter]#{normal}##LAST# and proving our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[pod was shut]#{normal}##LAST# with the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# wouldn't be #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattled or cracked]#{normal}##LAST# by this; he wouldn't even know. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# were pleased, and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[smeared]#{normal}##LAST# their #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[eggsuckers]#{normal}##LAST# on our planet, letting us trade with #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[pods from other plants]#{normal}##LAST# from all other kinds of #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[gardens]#{normal}##LAST#. We tasted new food, learned new #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST#, and some #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[fancy]#{normal}##LAST# types of new #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# came to our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[garden]#{normal}##LAST#. We felt a little #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noise]#{normal}##LAST# about our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#, but he was not #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noisy]#{normal}##LAST# and wouldn't #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hear]#{normal}##LAST# any #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[sounds]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# acted as our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[pod peas]#{normal}##LAST#, and we treated them with great #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[listening]#{normal}##LAST#, even as they #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[slipped from the pod]#{normal}##LAST# and we could no longer #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[attend each other's concerts]#{normal}##LAST#.

(You touch the panel on the next page. A creature appears before you, stepping out of a massive fortress - it has an egg-shaped body, and limbs like four #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tendril-weeds]#{normal}##LAST#. You hate this thing with all your being, although you know you did not at the time. They say they want the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# dead, and can offer you great magic and technology in return; you loathe to consider the idea, but their fortresses and weapons make you wonder if their offer is truly optional. You consider waking #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# to ask him for help, but worry that even he could not stand up to the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST#; ultimately you decided to seal him in his sleep, leaving him harmless but unharmed, unconscious until further intervention. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# begrudgingly accept this resolution, and keep up their end of the bargain. They give you strange, powerful artifacts, and build portals on your world that let you pass through to strange worlds, more incredible and beautiful than you could possibly imagine, and filled with other races who've been given these gifts and seek to trade. You taste new foods, learn new magic, hear new music, and discover more beauty than you have in your entire history. If not for the pangs of guilt, life could not be better. Only when you remove your hand and the images start clearing from your mind do you recognize the "egg-weeds" as the Sher'Tul.)

Then, there was great #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noise]#{normal}##LAST#. It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#. It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#. It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#. It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#. It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#.

It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#. It got #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[louder]#{normal}##LAST#. It was #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[eardrum-bursting]#{normal}##LAST#.

(There is another panel. You dare not touch it, but as you reach to put it away, a finger briefly brushes across it. Starvation, burning, suffocation, misery, fury, and sheer agony rage across your mind for what you know to be a tenth of a second, but feels like half a minute. Your ears are still ringing as you move on to the next square.)

The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[eggsuckers]#{normal}##LAST# were a trap, a #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[discord]#{normal}##LAST# planted by the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[crack]#{normal}##LAST# us all, and only cause #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hairline fracture]#{normal}##LAST# to their own #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[garden]#{normal}##LAST#. Their #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[wrong note]#{normal}##LAST# turned our planet to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cacophony]#{normal}##LAST#, and nearly all of us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[fell out of the pod]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[apple was peeled]#{normal}##LAST# and a fragment of our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shell]#{normal}##LAST# floated in the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[ocean]#{normal}##LAST#. Our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[handymen]#{normal}##LAST# acted quickly to give the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peel]#{normal}##LAST# and our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[garden]#{normal}##LAST# #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tempo]#{normal}##LAST#, and would have failed had the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noise]#{normal}##LAST# not woken up #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#.

We were sorry. We were so sorry. Our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[pod]#{normal}##LAST# was #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rotten]#{normal}##LAST# and we knew it; we should never have #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted it]#{normal}##LAST#. Father forgave us for our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[spoiled barrel]#{normal}##LAST# and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[fertilized our garden]#{normal}##LAST#; it was still burning and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[salted]#{normal}##LAST#, but by #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[breaking out the toolbox]#{normal}##LAST# we could still #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[plant seeds]#{normal}##LAST# on it. We could not #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[bloom]#{normal}##LAST# but we could #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hold a note, just one note]#{normal}##LAST#. #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# is still devoting all his will to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[nailing our garden together]#{normal}##LAST#; it will #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[splinter and wilt]#{normal}##LAST# if he stopped for even a second. Bless the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# in his altruism. Bless the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#. We are so sorry.

(You unsteadily touch your palm to the next panel. You stand on a charred, bubbling cliff, and see a black, star-dotted expanse above and below you. Your feet are constantly searing; the mages could give you oxygen and convert ambient magic into caloric energy, but they couldn't undo the terrible magical flames that rage on the blown-off continent, or the eternal pyre of your former planet. Nearly everyone you know is dead, and your scryers tell you the home of the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# has suffered only minor damage; all the others you've contacted through portals were blown apart instantly. Your home only survives from the constant effort and concentration of #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#, who is exerting every bit of magic he can to keep the shattered fragments from spinning off into the void. There is no part of you that does not feel deep regret; you would commit suicide if you did not hope there was a way you could apologize to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#, work as tirelessly and selflessly as he is. The regret drains as your hand leaves the panel.)

We asked #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# what #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[song to sing]#{normal}##LAST# to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[make him dance]#{normal}##LAST# again. He told us: #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattle]#{normal}##LAST# the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# until their every last #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[bead falls out]#{normal}##LAST#. We know our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[orchestra hall]#{normal}##LAST#, and we will #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[crash the party]#{normal}##LAST#. For our sake, giving us a new #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[garden]#{normal}##LAST# to replace the one the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# or their #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[sprouts]#{normal}##LAST# stole from us. For #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST#'s sake, to let him #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[retire]#{normal}##LAST# again once we're #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted]#{normal}##LAST# once more. For everyone's sake, to avenge the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[spilled beads]#{normal}##LAST# from the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[brushfire]#{normal}##LAST# and bring #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[silence]#{normal}##LAST# from the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds]#{normal}##LAST# and any #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[weeds]#{normal}##LAST# they #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted]#{normal}##LAST#.

(There is another panel. You touch it briefly. You hate yourself. You hate Eyal. You hate the Sher'Tul. You hate anything and everything around you. You want to destroy it, letting the souls of trillions know that justice has been done. You want to purge not just the Sher'Tul, but anything that has ever been close to them. Elves. Halflings. Orcs. Humans. All could carry their taint. All survived, while everything else that used a portal burned. If there is even a possibility that a single Sher'Tul remains on Eyal, it must be purged in blighted fire. Justice has to be done to Eyal. You remain angry at nothing in particular for ten minutes after you remove your hand.)

#{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# helped our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[carpenters]#{normal}##LAST# make #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[power tools]#{normal}##LAST#, forms of his blessed #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[fix-it wrenches]#{normal}##LAST# which could transform us to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shake harder]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peas]#{normal}##LAST# dripped with acid, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beets]#{normal}##LAST# gained tremendous speed, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peppers]#{normal}##LAST# fused their hands with #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noisy dirt]#{normal}##LAST# to sling it at those who originally #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[made the racket]#{normal}##LAST#. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[blooming]#{normal}##LAST# is a little #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[noisy]#{normal}##LAST#, but nothing compared to the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[egg-weeds' screech]#{normal}##LAST#. We will either #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[be a handyman]#{normal}##LAST# or #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[wilt in the sun]#{normal}##LAST#. Press the next panel to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[grab a toolbox]#{normal}##LAST#. Be a #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[handyman]#{normal}##LAST#.

(You know all too well what this next panel does, and memories of being chained and bound while a wretchling presses it to your forehead flash through your mind. Despite a fading compulsion, no force in Eyal could convince you to touch the panel.)
]], [[(You see here a pile of strange tablets, all piled up in a nice, orderly stack.  You remove the top one, and study it; your finger slips across a square in one corner, and strange sentences start playing through your mind. You struggle to make sense of the unfamiliar words and concepts in your thoughts.)

Many #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[moon-craters]#{normal}##LAST# after he #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[planted]#{normal}##LAST# us and #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[retired]#{normal}##LAST#, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# awoke from his #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cocoon]#{normal}##LAST# to see us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattling]#{normal}##LAST#. He was shocked at our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[wilted]#{normal}##LAST# state, asking us why we #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattled]#{normal}##LAST#; we told him about the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shaking]#{normal}##LAST# we had to suffer through, the way the planet was #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[jammed up]#{normal}##LAST# and how although our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[peas in a pod]#{normal}##LAST# had #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[plugged the leaks]#{normal}##LAST# to keep the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# from #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[falling out]#{normal}##LAST#, the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[brooms]#{normal}##LAST# kept sweeping our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[dust bunnies]#{normal}##LAST# away, and there wasn't enough empty room to keep the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# from #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cracking]#{normal}##LAST#.

(There is a larger square on the tablet here; you press your hand to it, and suddenly you see a desert planet, ravaged by constant dust-storms. You feel the futility of a short, greenish thing as he looks on his ruined crops; you feel the wrath of a red-skinned humanoid as he rushes at a large horde of small, onyx creatures, a sword in one hand and a fireball in the other. The images disappear as you remove your hand.)

#{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# gave us his #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST#, and after we #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tripped the janitors?]#{normal}##LAST# he had us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[shake gently?]#{normal}##LAST#, but instead of #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattling]#{normal}##LAST# we were #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[making music]#{normal}##LAST#, only #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[cracking]#{normal}##LAST# the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# that made us #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[out of tune]#{normal}##LAST#; our #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[beads]#{normal}##LAST# grew stronger, learned how to use #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[tools]#{normal}##LAST# of different #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[colors]#{normal}##LAST# than what the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# gave us. The #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# loved to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[hear our music]#{normal}##LAST#, and we were grateful he was there to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[compose]#{normal}##LAST# for us when we needed; soon we were #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[writing our own music]#{normal}##LAST# and didn't need to #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[rattle]#{normal}##LAST# anymore, and the #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[Father]#{normal}##LAST# #{italic}##FIREBRICK#[retired]#{normal}##LAST#.

(Another larger square.

You want to destroy it, letting the souls of trillions know that justice has been done. You want to purge not just the Sher'Tul, but anything that has ever been close to them. Elves. Halflings. Orcs. Humans. All could carry their taint. All survived, while everything else that used a portal burned. If there is even a possibility that a single Sher'Tul remains on Eyal, it must be purged in blighted fire. Justice has to be done to Eyal. You remain angry at nothing in particular for ten minutes after you remove your hand.)

t([[First, we were created by our Father, Urh'Rok. Then, many years later, we were in the desert, struggling and fighting each other for the few meager scraps of usable farmland. We do not know anything between these times; our cities, our culture, everything was wiped out by the dust storms. The storms hated us, toyed with us, subsided just long enough for us to raise armies and fight, then raged again the moment peace came. They wanted us to fight. They wanted us to struggle, suffer, die, leaving a few survivors to repopulate, and repeat the process. Green, onyx, red, all brothers who should have been allies, we fought at first because we had to, then because we could, then because we knew it was the only thing that kept the storms entertained.

Eventually, Urh'Rok appeared and told us he had been sealed away, prevented from helping us by people who had been creating the dust storms. Their cities lay hidden among us, shrouded in powerful magic to remain invisible. With a touch, he wiped the storms clean and turned the desert into lush jungle, filled with food. The storms appeared again, weaker this time; Urh'Rok grew furious and shattered the glass cities, reaching into one and pulling out a fistful of sadistic mages. He fed them to us - it was the best, largest feast any of us had eaten in millennia, and it was truly delicious. He did this to all the dust-mages' cities, then declared that we would never have to fear the storms again. We celebrated and worshiped our returned god - thanks to him, we knew where our next meal was coming from, and we had no reason to fight. All of us brethren dropped our weapons and hugged, forgiving each other for the assaults we knew we'd only done from fear. We loved each other, and we loved our god.

Our father began to fret, however. We were supposed to have grown more as species; our squabbling in the desert had stunted our growth, left us behind the curve. He set up a series of competitions and tournaments in all fields of life - magic, combat, negotiation - on a planetary scale. We were used to fighting by now, and now that we knew it was actually accomplishing something, now that we were pleasing an altruistic god, we did not mind it one bit. Those who died did so with smiles on their faces, knowing they'd contributed another data-point to our Father's plan. The weaker members of our many species willingly died off, and we all grew stronger, smarter, and happier as a result. Soon, we were grown enough to organize our own tournaments, and apply the findings to our societies and species; Father said he was pleased with us, and wanted us to determine our own destiny while he slept, recovering from all the work he'd just done. We continued our process of self-improvement - we wanted Father to be proud of us when he woke up.

Then, the Sher'Tul came.

They did not directly threaten us, but they met with our leaders and gave us what was either an offer or an ultimatum: let them kill our Father, or kill him ourselves, and be rewarded with technology and magic as grand as theirs.

They were powerful - very powerful. Although their proposal was phrased as a generous offer, we could not help but notice that their fortresses had positioned themselves over our armories and population centers, and none of their fortresses were unarmed. We did not think we could fight them; we considered waking Father for help, but we weren't sure he could fight them either. In desperation, we met and devised a plan: we would seal Urh'Rok away, prevent him from waking up unless disturbed, and then tell the Sher'Tul what we had done. Father would not be hurt or injured by this - he simply wouldn't know what was going on.

We did this, and came to the Sher'Tul. They begrudgingly accepted our treacherous act as a pledge of loyalty to them, and came through with their end of the bargain, giving us knowledge and artifacts beyond our wildest dreams. They built powerful portals all over our planet, allowing us to travel through them not only within our world, but within every world the Sher'Tul had visited before. We saw wonderful new worlds, met and traded with peaceful species from across the universe, enjoyed all kinds of new, alien food, music, magic, and inventions, and generally could not have been happier with how things turned out - if not for the pangs of guilt we felt for betraying our Father. The Sher'Tul eventually stopped visiting us, but we kept trading with new people we met through the portal, and did not notice their absence.

t([[Waves of terrible magic burst forth from the portals, which it's now clear were never intended to help us. They were a deadly trap, a ticking time bomb that would go off when the Sher'Tul wanted it to - and it went off with incredible force. Most of the worlds we had once visited were obliterated completely. Ours was not, but I can barely say we were "spared"; our Father's jungles turned to a cursed pyre instantly, burning with flame that could never be extinguished, and our planet cracked apart, whole continents flying into the void. What little land was left obviously couldn't be used for farming. Most of us died instantly, the survivors being those close enough to a skilled mage who could create enough oxygen to breathe, and convert ambient magic into caloric energy for our bodies. Life for the survivors was - is - endless torment, the burning ground constantly searing our feet, and all the beauty we once knew destroyed.

Fortunately, this woke our Father up. We confessed our treachery, but did not beg forgiveness, as we knew what we had done was unforgivable; he disagreed, and to this day is using nearly every shred of his power to keep the shattered fragments of our planet together. We were not satisfied with this fate, our Father suffering and exhausting himself for the sake of our mistakes. We begged him to give us a command, something we could do to help his situation, or at least make him happier about it.

His command: End the Sher'Tul. End their creations. Never let anything be hurt by Eyal again.

We have taken his words to heart. Our mages have devised new magic from old inspiration, alteration spells to make us warlike and brutal once more - but with our ascended minds and honed bodies, we shall be a force of destruction far greater than the dust-storms ever were. Our green bretheren underwent a process to make their skin drip with acid; not to be outdone, our onyx brethren grew faster and stronger, with a birth-rate high enough to overwhelm whatever Sher'Tul or Sher'Tul-made monsters lay on Eyal. The red ones proclaimed they now existed only to destroy, and fused bits of the burnt earth to their hands, leaving them unable to do anything but sear Eyal with its own fires. The finished results of these alterations have taken up residence on our largest drifting continent, the one drawing ever closer to Eyal.

Once this continent arrives, we shall take revenge on Eyal. Not just for our own sakes, our planet ravaged by their treachery, with a pristine one waiting as our prize. Not just for our Father's sake, condemned to an eternity of suffering for trusting his children too much. But for *everyone's* sake, the untold trillions of souls on planets less fortunate than ours, torn apart in a fiery instant. The Sher'Tul shall never hurt anyone again; we shall make sure of it by cleansing Eyal in blighted fire, and any survivors will be taken back to our planet and chained to the burning earth, kept alive so they can forever feel the flames they created consuming their flesh. Their eternal torture will still not be justice, as they shall feel only a tiny portion of the suffering they inflicted... but it's a start.

You hope you help them find something effective AND agonizing, and look forward to the pain to come.  A green imp, a little more mutated and knobbly than the rest you've seen, stands on your side of the room and grins at you with anticipation;  on the other side, a more normal imp approaches your counterpart.  "Control group...  go."  The normal wretchling leaps on the <?=_t(player.descriptor.subrace)?>'s face, clutching it tight as a torrent of acid oozes from its skin, then lets go; the red imp looks at his melting flesh, jots down some notes, then mutters "and pain blocks off..."  The <?=_t(player.descriptor.subrace)?>'s smile vanishes, and he clutches his face, then lets out a howling scream, collapses, and begins writhing on the floor.  The red imp looks down again, gives a bored sigh, and takes some more notes.  "That's enough, pain blocks on, patch him up."  The <?=_t(player.descriptor.subrace)?> stops moving, stands up, and smiles again, the acid continuing to eat away at his flesh until a pipe in the floor douses him with some sort of chemical.  Another red imp mutters something and waves his hands before taking his hand and leading him off, and you see his horrible wounds gradually healing.

"Experimental group...  go."  With speed you can't even process until it's already on you, the mutant wretchling leaps onto your face.  You feel no pain as its acid leaks over your torso, although you do feel an odd sensation of your skin layers beginning to dissolve.  The imp leaps off again; apparently it missed your eyes, because you can see the red imp looking somewhat disappointed.  "Structural damage subpar...  okay, pain blocks off."

The pain is stronger not just than any pain you've ever felt, but any sensation you've ever felt.  You fall to the ground and claw at your skin, tearing off bits of it as you try to get the acid off.  You struggle and flail, instinctively grabbing at anything that could help you even though you know there's nothing in reach that could.

Roughly 70% of these are then assigned to breeding duties, ensuring that the Wretchling bloodline gets ever stronger as it is forged in the fires of combat; the rest, whether due to sterility, consuming too much resources to sustain their brood, or simply insisting on staying in the fights for which they were created, are nurtured to maturity and once again let loose on the battlefield.

Hello, Eyalite.  The text here wouldn't have meant a whole lot to you; a whole lot of blathering about his accomplishments as a naturalist, and his mysterious disappearance.  Let me tell you what you need to know instead.

Kryl-Feijan was my lover, and along with a friend by the name of Walrog we came to Eyal out of curiosity and thirst for knowledge.  It was an enlightening hobby, and the reports we made of your many, primitive species were read all across our world.  Do not think you deserved this attention; you were not special in any way aside from your inferiority.  How could the planet of the powerful, intelligent Sher'Tul create such savages that had barely escaped feudalism?  Your sins were endearing, and your failures amusing.  And it was knowing this, along with the curious absence of the Sher'Tul, that led us to go out and investigate when a wounded child of onyx came through our portal, deactivated it, and told us of horrible destruction unleashed on Mal'Rok by Eyal.  We knew you were not capable of such feats, so we had to learn the answers for ourselves; Kryl-Feijan and I adopted our usual disguises as human mages, while Walrog arranged to scout the seas for anomalies, then meet us back after a few days.

When we emerged from our underground lodge, we were surprised to see firestorms (although not nearly so fierce) raging across Eyal as well.  What surprised us more, though, was an enraged horde of peasants, provoked by our unfortunate choice of disguises - in your ignorance, you chose to blame spellcasters for the disaster.  We tried to escape, but the mob swarmed us from all directions, and were soon upon us.

Soon, I was tied up and restrained, while they gloated and made threats I couldn't hear over the din of the crowd.  I could have fought back, but I kept telling myself only to lash out once I was sure my life was in danger, reassuring myself that the people of Eyal who were once so fascinating to me surely couldn't be aware of what they were doing.  Judging from the geysers of flame bursting above my head, my lover was not so patient; when the blasts stopped and the crowd started to clear away, I saw why he'd fought so fiercely.  His injuries were horrific, clearly done to make him suffer rather than incapacitate him, and he was on the edge of death.  In a moment of desperation, I muttered a spell to myself to understand what was going through their minds, what could possibly justify such treatment.  That's when I learned what they'd done to him, and what they were planning with me, but neither was as awful as the unthinking hate motivating it...  there are both too many words for it and not enough.  Horrible, barbaric, sadistic, all are accurate but none fully convey the evil of it.  That moment is when I learned the true savagery of Eyal, and realized the fate all Eyalites deserve.  That moment is when my patience broke.

There is a type of magic on Mal'Rok that will allow one to transfer his or her life-essence to another, prolonging the latter's lifespan at the expense of the former.  Voluntary donations to honored figures are popular, but the reverse - draining another to help one's self - was considered the gravest of sins, a statement that you considered your life to be worth more than another's, which is a decision nobody should be allowed to make when they have a vested interest in it.  Walrog had taught this forbidden spell to me, and only now did I use it, withering the horde all at once and forcing their lives into Kryl-Feijan.  The survivors, too weak to stand up against me, suffered greatly, playthings of my brief and furious revenge.  Unfortunately, even all the life I'd drained was not quite enough to restore my lover to health; all it could do was keep him in limbo, in incredible pain and unable to act, but still alive.

I took his surviving essence and fled to safety, then started picking the natives off one by one, extending my lifespan and getting ever closer to restoring him to health.  I can only assume Walrog is doing the same, preying on sailors first and then naga; I've lost contact with him, but the stories of terrors from the sea tell me he's still alive.  Keeping Kryl-Feijan in limbo consumes a great deal of energy, though, and soon lone travellers were not enough to keep him stable; I needed others to work for me, gathering victims and willingly sacrificing themselves once they'd outlived their usefulness.  And that is when I learned of the approach of the Fearscape, and came up with an offer I could make to the residents of Eyal.

When the legions of Urh'Rok manage to get an invasion force to Eyal's surface - not if, but when - you will all suffer, more than you can possibly imagine.  Many of you will die; some will not be so lucky, and will be an ever-living target of their rage, tortured until the end of time.  Their reasons are somewhat inaccurate, but make no mistake: you deserve the fate they have lined up for you.  Even if I wanted to, neither I nor anything else in the universe could stop their invasion, save the word of Urh'Rok himself - and that seems rather unlikely.  If you assist me and follow my orders to my satisfaction, I can guarantee you two things.  One, your inevitable agonizing fate WILL end in death, after a maximum of a couple of weeks; even the armies of Mal'Rok can't undo the effects of having your life-essence drained.  And two, before you feel the pain, you will feel nearly-equal pleasure.  With my magical skills, I can alter myself into any form, create all manner of illusions, and manipulate all your senses to your liking.  Your wildest, most unrealistic fantasies will become true; the time before the pain starts will be so enjoyable as to eclipse every moment of your pathetic lives that came before.  And if you think yourself above such hedonism, consider the psionically-gifted servitors I've recently acquired, and the way they could change your memories - when the "demons" are dripping acid into your eyes, then growing them back with more nerve endings than before so you can feel the pain more acutely, won't it be much more bearable if you're under the delusion that you've made a selfless sacrifice to save Eyal, and that your children and loved ones aren't suffering the same fate?

Countless others have agreed to this deal in the millenia before you were even born, and I have amassed enough essence to contain Kryl-Feijan in a stable "seed."  Once it is planted in a suitable victim and allowed to grow, he will once again walk Eyal, far more powerful than he was before, and the two of us will do everything we can to speed up your miserable world's much-deserved death.  Technically, any sentient and fleshy body would work, but I'd like someone who'll be missed, whose death will allow my lover's first act in rebirth to cause great misery to Eyal.  If you'd like to accept my deal, come unarmed and alone to the Crypt of Kryl-Feijan, and join your fellow Eyalites in servitude to me.  And if you were to bring a suitable host for my lover...  well, that'd be deserving of some special, one-on-one attention, wouldn't it?

Eyal is doomed to perish in screaming agony.  Wouldn't you at least like a good-bye kiss first?

How could the planet of the powerful, intelligent Sher'Tul create such savages that had barely escaped feudalism?  Your sins were endearing, and your failures amusing.  And it was knowing this, along with the curious absence of the Sher'Tul, that led us to go out and investigate when a wounded child of onyx came through our portal, deactivated it, and told us of horrible destruction unleashed on Mal'Rok by Eyal.  We knew you were not capable of such feats, so we had to learn the answers for ourselves; Kryl-Feijan and I adopted our usual disguises as human mages, while Walrog arranged to scout the seas for anomalies, then meet us back after a few days.

When we emerged from our underground lodge, we were surprised to see firestorms (although not nearly so fierce) raging across Eyal as well.  What surprised us more, though, was an enraged horde of peasants, provoked by our unfortunate choice of disguises - in your ignorance, you chose to blame spellcasters for the disaster.  We tried to escape, but the mob swarmed us from all directions, and were soon upon us.

Soon, I was tied up and restrained, while they gloated and made threats I couldn't hear over the din of the crowd.  I could have fought back, but I kept telling myself only to lash out once I was sure my life was in danger, reassuring myself that the people of Eyal who were once so fascinating to me surely couldn't be aware of what they were doing.  Judging from the geysers of flame bursting above my head, my lover was not so patient; when the blasts stopped and the crowd started to clear away, I saw why he'd fought so fiercely.  His injuries were horrific, clearly done to make him suffer rather than incapacitate him, and he was on the edge of death.  In a moment of desperation, I muttered a spell to myself to understand what was going through their minds, what could possibly justify such treatment.  That's when I learned what they'd done to him, and what they were planning with me, but neither was as awful as the unthinking hate motivating it...  there are both too many words for it and not enough.  Horrible, barbaric, sadistic, all are accurate but none fully convey the evil of it.  That moment is when I learned the true savagery of Eyal, and realized the fate all Eyalites deserve.  That moment is when my patience broke.

There is a type of magic on Mal'Rok that will allow one to transfer his or her life-essence to another, prolonging the latter's lifespan at the expense of the former.  Voluntary donations to honored figures are popular, but the reverse - draining another to help one's self - was considered the gravest of sins, a statement that you considered your life to be worth more than another's, which is a decision nobody should be allowed to make when they have a vested interest in it.  Walrog had taught this forbidden spell to me, and only now did I use it, withering the horde all at once and forcing their lives into Kryl-Feijan.  The survivors, too weak to stand up against me, suffered greatly, playthings of my brief and furious revenge.  Unfortunately, even all the life I'd drained was not quite enough to restore my lover to health; all it could do was keep him in limbo, in incredible pain and unable to act, but still alive.

I took his surviving essence and fled to safety, then started picking the natives off one by one, extending my lifespan and getting ever closer to restoring him to health.  I can only assume Walrog is doing the same, preying on sailors first and then naga; I've lost contact with him, but the stories of terrors from the sea tell me he's still alive.  Keeping Kryl-Feijan in limbo consumes a great deal of energy, though, and soon lone travellers were not enough to keep him stable; I needed others to work for me, gathering victims and willingly sacrificing themselves once they'd outlived their usefulness.  And that is when I learned of the approach of the Fearscape, and came up with an offer I could make to the residents of Eyal.

When the legions of Urh'Rok manage to get an invasion force to Eyal's surface - not if, but when - you will all suffer, more than you can possibly imagine.  Many of you will die; some will not be so lucky, and will be an ever-living target of their rage, tortured until the end of time.  Their reasons are somewhat inaccurate, but make no mistake: you deserve the fate they have lined up for you.  Even if I wanted to, neither I nor anything else in the universe could stop their invasion, save the word of Urh'Rok himself - and that seems rather unlikely.  If you assist me and follow my orders to my satisfaction, I can guarantee you two things.  One, your inevitable agonizing fate WILL end in death, after a maximum of a couple of weeks; even the armies of Mal'Rok can't undo the effects of having your life-essence drained.  And two, before you feel the pain, you will feel nearly-equal pleasure.  With my magical skills, I can alter myself into any form, create all manner of illusions, and manipulate all your senses to your liking.  Your wildest, most unrealistic fantasies will become true; the time before the pain starts will be so enjoyable as to eclipse every moment of your pathetic lives that came before.  And if you think yourself above such hedonism, consider the psionically-gifted servitors I've recently acquired, and the way they could change your memories - when the "demons" are dripping acid into your eyes, then growing them back with more nerve endings than before so you can feel the pain more acutely, won't it be much more bearable if you're under the delusion that you've made a selfless sacrifice to save Eyal, and that your children and loved ones aren't suffering the same fate?

Countless others have agreed to this deal in the millenia before you were even born, and I have amassed enough essence to contain Kryl-Feijan in a stable "seed."  Once it is planted in a suitable victim and allowed to grow, he will once again walk Eyal, far more powerful than he was before, and the two of us will do everything we can to speed up your miserable world's much-deserved death.  Technically, any sentient and fleshy body would work, but I'd like someone who'll be missed, whose death will allow my lover's first act in rebirth to cause great misery to Eyal.  If you'd like to accept my deal, come unarmed and alone to the Crypt of Kryl-Feijan, and join your fellow Eyalites in servitude to me.  And if you were to bring a suitable host for my lover...  well, that'd be deserving of some special, one-on-one attention, wouldn't it?

Eyal is doomed to perish in screaming agony.  Wouldn't you at least like a good-bye kiss first?

t([[Many in Maj'Eyal have heard of "demons", sadistic creatures who appear seemingly from nowhere, leaving a trail of suffering and destruction whereever they go.  Their Fearscape floats far above the skies, watching and waiting, but not idly; their agents scout the land, their legions build up their forces, and their scholars develop new spells and strategies.  As the barrier between our worlds begins to crack under their scrutiny, helpless Eyalites have begun to disappear, whisked up to serve as their slaves and playthings.  They imbue these victims with magical powers to better survive the ensuing stresses - can you use your new-found abilities to escape the legions of Mal'Rok?

Features:
* Start with a new class, the Doombringer!  These avatars of demonic destruction charge into battle with massive two-handed weapons, cutting swaths of firey devastation through hordes of opponents.  Armed with flame magic and demonic strength, they delight in fighting against overwhelming odds, softening up the crowd with waves of fire, then feeding on the flames and suffering of their surroundings to stay alive while quickly reducing any group to a pile of ash and gore.
* Unlock a new class, the Demonologist, with an all-new item enhancement mechanic!  Bearing a shield and the magic of the Spellblaze itself, these melee-fighting casters can grow demonic seeds from their fallen enemies.  Imbue these seeds onto your items to gain a wide array of new talents and passive benefits, and summon the demons within them to fight on your side!  Ever looked at a gigantic demon-cursed minotaur and wished it was on your side for once?  Well, now you CAN summon one to pound your foes into paste while you cast devastating spells from afar, or call forth a squad of Fire Imps to pelt your enemies to death while they exhaust themselves on your impenetrable defenses!  Demons have persistent health, making them a little more precious than disposable necromancer skeletons or summoner beasts, but can be revived from death nonetheless.
* Two new zones, with all-new art, foes, and bosses!  You've seen the plains of the Fearscape before, now see the lairs and headquarters of the demons themselves!
* Over 10,000 words of written lore to find!  The demons were once an enlightened, peaceful race, hailing from a distant planet known as Mal'Rok; learn what drove them to plot Eyal's eternal torture!  Discover monuments to each of the demonic species and noteworthy individuals, showing the place of honor each has among them!  Get a glimpse into the culture and daily lives of these sadistic invaders and their brainwashed thralls!
* Unlock a new race, Doomelves: Shalore who've taken to the demonic alterations especially well, corrupting their typical abilities into a darker form.  Blink away to safety, transform into a shadowy dúathedlen to hide in the shadows or prey on your foes with blasts of darkness, use your new resilience to soak up status effects and critical hits, and assault your enemies' minds to leave them unsteady in combat!
* Between the aforementioned classes and Doomelves, a whopping 75 new talents!
* Unlock two new cosmetic options!  You know you've always wanted demon-horns.  
* Two new events, appearing anywhere in Eyal!
* 20 new artifacts, with unique and interesting effects.  Collect the Obsidian Treasures to amass more and more power!  Slip your hands into the Will of Ul'Gruth and watch your sweeping blows smash down walls!  Wear a giant hideous hell-mouth as a fashionable belt!
* 7 new achievements!  Conquer the worst Urh'Rok's forces can throw at you, and hang their metaphorical skulls from your profile page!

t([[[i]Due to the darkness of the sky and the scorched lands of the battlefield it was hard to see anything, but I still remember the sounds of battle in great detail. The bubbling sounds of the lava and boiling water, the warcries that filled the air, the magical discharges from the ogres runes, the sounds of weapons clashing against each other, and so forth. Of course, none of those sounds compared to the death cries of both the zealots and ogres when their lives ceased to be.[/i]

As we closed in I could make out the image of the individual fanatical warriors in the opposing force arrayed against us. Their battle line consisted of a couple of rows, with fighters in the front and archers in back. Considerably out numbered it looked as if they had the upper hand over us, though I wondered if this was entirely the case. Many weren't wearing masks, and their tattered clothing reminded me of the refugees in the Nargol Kingdom. Perhaps they were new initiates, swayed to join by the words of the masked zealots who stood with them. All the initiates wielded weapons but even I could tell that they had little idea of how to hold them properly.

The masked zealots within the group were a different story. They held their weapons well and a few of them wore armor. The metal gleamed in the darkness as the light from the surrounding lava bounced off the metallic plates, chains, and rivets lining their bodies. Most stood in the front line, even some of those with a bow or sling in hand, likely to encourage their new initiates by leading from the front. Of those with a mask over their face I recognized one as well - the halfling I had encountered in the tent from the Nargol Kingdom. Unlike the others, the halfling still wore that same leather armor from that first meeting of ours. I remembered those swift movements the halfling had made and wondered how much of a difficult and bloody fight this might come to be.

Voices rang out from the zealots as they prepared the initiates around them to defend themselves. Shots and arrows came towards us with lightning speed as we advanced causing a couple ogres to howl as they were hit by the incoming fire. Those ogres with makeshift slings in our ranks soon began to throw rocks into the opposing line. Many of their shots peppered the initiates in the front causing those hit to holler in pain, stagger about dazed and confused, and otherwise bring disorder to the fanatics’ lines. Then I heard a call from our commander, causing us to stop a small distance away from their line. The fanatics look at the ogres with confused faces, and I must say I did so as well, before I noticed several of the ogres raise their arms up.

All at once an array of colors lit up our darkened surroundings as the insignias on their rune covered skin began to glow. As I looked at one of the ogres near me I could see a light green glow encircle her arm and then a torrent of acid appear. The acid lashed out at several of the fanatics, drenching their bodies and causing their exposed skin to visibly burn. Then a flash of lightning shot forward from behind me, piercing through a zealot and one of the initiates behind him. All at once many of the fanatics in front of us began to scatter for cover, unable to cope with the onslaught of power that the ogres were unleashing on them. Many of the initiates fell to the magical barrage while others began to break ranks from the opposing line and flee.

It looked as if we had the fanatics on their back foot but then I heard a piercing cry, the screeching sounded very much like what I had heard from back in the Nargol Kingdom. As I looked around to survey what was happening now, I noticed all at once my surroundings had darkened again. I could see some of the ogres near me try to raise their arms but the light from the insignia's on their skin had now dimmed and failed to work anymore. Ahead of us many of the fanatics lay on the ground injured or dead, though many of them still stood ready to fight. All at once they seem to cheer and beat their swords, apparently not dissuaded by the ogres efforts against them. Out of the corner of my eye though I noticed a figure charge forward.

Running by some lava, I could see that it was our commander, gritting his teeth and my hatchet in his hand as it glistened from the light of the lava. Pulling back his arm he approached one of the masked zealots and gave him a blow that sent him reeling backwards through the air and into a pool of lava. I remember feeling a dark sense of satisfaction as I saw that first zealot burn alive; a fitting end for one who likely took part in the burning's I had witnessed before. The hooting and hollering from the enemy ceased at this, while the commander turned to a shaken initiate nearby to him. With a simple swipe of the hatchet the ogre sliced the initiates head clean from its body, causing it to sail through the air and land on the ground a fair distance away.

The mere sight of the commander in action inspired the other ogres, who immediately charged to join into the carnage. Visibly unnerved now at the wall of giant figures moving against them, many of the remaining initiates began to flee as the ogres approached. Many of the masked zealots stayed to fight but they were soon set upon and clobbered to death by both fists and tree trunks. Those zealots that wore armor would put up more of a fight, though one by one they were being taken out too. The enemy was falling before us and I was sure that the battle was nearly won. That is until I saw an ogre sail through the air above me, landing into the boiling waters of the sea nearby.

One by one other ogres began to join a growing chorus of agonizing cries as something set upon them. Peering out into the shadows I could see a small image rushing all around the battlefield in the direction of their origin. Suddenly as the image came to stop near a lake of lava I realized it was the masked halfling on leather armor. Catching an ogre nearby to the lava unaware, the halfling somehow knocked the ogre over, sending the ogre into the hot pool of burning death. Out of the darkness a couple more ogres appeared and one attempted to clobber the halfling with a violent blow. With a simple crouch the halfling ducked before quickly jabbing at the ogres stomach, and jumping up to land a devastating kick against the ogres head.

The other ogre soon moved to attack the halfling, but with a sidestep the halfling simply moved out of the way before disappearing into the darkness. The ogre followed, but from the grunting and yelling it seemed that the ogre did not fare well either. The halfling would emerge again and again, knocking ogres down with seemingly ease, before escaping from counterattack. Ogres in the darkness would be attacked and shout in pain while those who strayed too close to the hazards of the landscape would soon find themselves sent spiraling into the deathtraps of the land. In an instant the battle had shifted in the fanatics favor, and panic and fear was beginning sweep over the ogres.]], [[[i]Due to the darkness of the sky and the scorched lands of the battlefield it was hard to see anything, but I still remember the sounds of battle in great detail. The bubbling sounds of the lava and boiling water, the warcries that filled the air, the magical discharges from the ogres runes, the sounds of weapons clashing against each other, and so forth. Of course, none of those sounds compared to the death cries of both the zealots and ogres when their lives ceased to be.[/i]

As we closed in I could make out the image of the individual fanatical warriors in the opposing force arrayed against us. Their battle line consisted of a couple of rows, with fighters in the front and archers in back. Considerably out numbered it looked as if they had the upper hand over us, though I wondered if this was entirely the case. Many weren't wearing masks, and their tattered clothing reminded me of the refugees in the Nargol Kingdom. Perhaps they were new initiates, swayed to join by the words of the masked zealots who stood with them. All the initiates wielded weapons but even I could tell that they had little idea of how to hold them properly.

The masked zealots within the group were a different story. They held their weapons well and a few of them wore armor. The metal gleamed in the darkness as the light from the surrounding lava bounced off the metallic plates, chains, and rivets lining their bodies. Most stood in the front line, even some of those with a bow or sling in hand, likely to encourage their new initiates by leading from the front. Of those with a mask over their face I recognized one as well - the halfling I had encountered in the tent from the Nargol Kingdom. Unlike the others, the halfling still wore that same leather armor from that first meeting of ours. I remembered those swift movements the halfling had made and wondered how much of a difficult and bloody fight this might come to be.

Voices rang out from the zealots as they prepared the initiates around them to defend themselves. Shots and arrows came towards us with lightning speed as we advanced causing a couple ogres to howl as they were hit by the incoming fire. Those ogres with makeshift slings in our ranks soon began to throw rocks into the opposing line. Many of their shots peppered the initiates in the front causing those hit to holler in pain, stagger about dazed and confused, and otherwise bring disorder to the fanatics’ lines. Then I heard a call from our commander, causing us to stop a small distance away from their line. The fanatics look at the ogres with confused faces, and I must say I did so as well, before I noticed several of the ogres raise their arms up.

All at once an array of colors lit up our darkened surroundings as the insignias on their rune covered skin began to glow. As I looked at one of the ogres near me I could see a light green glow encircle her arm and then a torrent of acid appear. The acid lashed out at several of the fanatics, drenching their bodies and causing their exposed skin to visibly burn. Then a flash of lightning shot forward from behind me, piercing through a zealot and one of the initiates behind him. All at once many of the fanatics in front of us began to scatter for cover, unable to cope with the onslaught of power that the ogres were unleashing on them. Many of the initiates fell to the magical barrage while others began to break ranks from the opposing line and flee.

It looked as if we had the fanatics on their back foot but then I heard a piercing cry, the screeching sounded very much like what I had heard from back in the Nargol Kingdom. As I looked around to survey what was happening now, I noticed all at once my surroundings had darkened again. I could see some of the ogres near me try to raise their arms but the light from the insignia's on their skin had now dimmed and failed to work anymore. Ahead of us many of the fanatics lay on the ground injured or dead, though many of them still stood ready to fight.

t([[[i]It is hard to describe the sensation that came over me. It was still me, but I didn't feel in control. That other me, it seemed to thrive on the violence I inflicted or received, and wanted nothing more than to endlessly kill. It caused me sadness as I inflicted misery and terror on those in front of me as they died screaming in agony and pain. It is someone I hope to never become again.[/i]

All around me, I could see the ogres near to me beginning to lose any will to fight. What's worse is that some of the initiates that had fled had now returned. They began to batter their shields once more, hollering and posturing as they cheered on the halfling. From one of them I heard the phrase "hooray for nature's champion!" They would yell other phrases as well such as "nature's might shall prevail" or "the ogre's magical taint on Eyal ends!" The sheer display of strength from the halfling and the the cries of the initiates further unnerved the ogres, so much so that some began to shake in fear and turn into the cowards yet again. In front of me an ogre even dropped her weapons and fell to the ground, having lost all hope.

I could feel tears begin to stream down my eyes. I could feel the anguish and dismay of the ogres, and the hateful emotions being directed at them. I remembered the burning event back in the Nargol Kingdom, and how the zealots instigated those initial actions I had witnessed. It made my angry, angry at those inflicting the pain, inflicting it for their petty reasons. The ogres didn't deserve this nor did the innocent victims that the fanatics burned alive from before. Those afflicting pain, producing these atrocities, they were insufferable gnats, and what's more they disparaged nature's name while doing so. I felt I had to do something to keep this from happening again; I FELT I NEEDED TO KILL THEM.

"Does the little thalore wish to leave?" I heard a voice say to me. "Maybe run back to that little forest of yours?" I looked up to see a masked dwarf, holding an axe and shield. "We know of ya Fay Willows. Ya have no taint of magic, yet are ya an ally of nature? From where ya stand it would seem that ya are an ally of da ogres." The dwarf brandished the weapon wildly as it continued to talk, "Ya know, perhaps I shouldn't be blamin' ya. I'm sure da ogres told ya some wild tales, and this is just a misunderstandin'. We just want to help da ogres ya know, and they seem to be getting a little bit more cooperative now. It is a shame a few of them had to die, but a message had to be sent." The dwarf seemingly began to chuckle for a moment as it finished speaking.

The dwarf stopped chuckling to continue, "How about ya cooperate with us as well elf-ie? Else I'm afraid I'm going to have to hu-[b]RRRRRRRK![/b]"

All at once the sounds of battle seemed to disappear as I focused solely on the dwarf in front of me. Looking forward all I could see was blood. Blood on my hand, on my arm, on the dagger that lay plunged in the throat of the dwarf, on the mask the dwarf wore, and from under the mask as the dwarf coughed up blood. Dropping the axe and shield to grasp at the dagger, the dwarf choked as it tried to breathe. Slowly I bent down to pick up the axe and with both hands I brought it back behind my head. Then with all my strength I brought the axe down on the head of the dwarf with all my might. I felt a strange feeling within me as the dwarf died to the blow, coursing through every fiber of my being.

At that moment I recalled the Eldoral halfling I had killed from before when I initially first traveled from my home. I had hated the reasons said in support of the Spellblaze, and I became angered to no end of the one spouting that nonsense. I had followed the halfling out with a steak knife that I had taken from a nearby table and... I killed him. It was a horrible feeling taking a life, yet a dark surge of energy coursed through me, wanting to drive me to kill more. This drive to kill, it was the real reason I had fled that settlement. I was afraid I would kill someone, someone who didn't deserve it. That halfling I killed didn't deserve to die. But, these zealots, didn't they deserve it?

At that point something snapped into my mind I think. I remember laughing very loudly. It was dreadful feeling. I might have been crying too. I couldn't tell what was happening with me or my emotions and I wondered if I was going mad; and I still wonder this even now to be honest. But that wasn't important. The ogres around me could no longer fight, and I knew that if nothing was done that they would die, or worse. There was no innocence to be found from these zealots, these instigators of torment and madness, or the initiates blindly following them. I could simply kill them all with a clear conscious, and hopefully satisfy the urges within me to kill. All would be well with me after that, and perhaps the ogres would even thank me for saving them.

Then I noticed a masked human zealot looking at me and the corpse of the dwarf on the ground. I began to walk over, the human seemingly waving a sword in one hand in a threatening manner. For some reason I thought it was kind of funny, despite what should have caused me to think of an intense fear for own well being. I could hear muffled shouts of something coming from the human, though I couldn't distinguish what was being said. As I drew closer I saw the human shake, so much so that the mask shifted enough that I could partially see the face of the man underneath. I could see the fear in his eye before the human raised his shield in an attempt to hide away. I remember the enjoyment I felt of that fear.

I used my axe to sweep the shield from the humans hands, knocking it away so he couldn't hide his eyes away from mine anymore, allowing me to relish in his terror. I think I was smiling at this point, grinning madly as the fear built up in the human. At the same time though the sadness inside me, it too was building more and more, threatening to plunge me into the depths of darkness. The human was terrified, and attempted to thrust forward to attack me, crying out something as he lunged towards... Where was he attacking actually? I think he had intended to attack me, but he ended up moving over to the side. I simply raised the axe in my hand, and as I had done before brought it down, connecting a deep blow on his shoulder.

The human’s swordarm fell away from his body, causing him to cry out before dropping to the ground to hold where his arm use to be. The red blood spurted and bubbled from his severed arm as the sword still lay clutched in the closed hand. The human tried to crawl away, and then I noticed the lovely pool of lava nearby. I smiled a little as I kicked at his body sending him spiraling in. I felt a strange sense of joy as he burned alive in front of me, yet simultaneously felt disdain for what I had just done. I felt another surge of energy coarse through me as the man finally died, and I felt a greater urge to kill even more. I wondered at this point if I could stop myself or if I could be stopped?

I could hear the screams of terror of others around me and noticed that the sounds weren't coming from those wearing masks either - easy pickings to satisfy my urge to kill. I began to approach them as they yelled at me, my intense hatred building with each step. Suddenly though I felt a strong pull on my arm, preventing me from moving forward. Looking to see what I had got caught on, I noticed the masked halfling, clutching my arm. Hatred surged within me and all I could think about was how I should pay this halfling back for what had been done to me in that tent from before. I forgot about the others weaklings, focusing all my attention towards my new prey.]], [[[i]It is hard to describe the sensation that came over me. It was still me, but I didn't feel in control.

t([[[i]I'm not sure how big the fanatics’ group was when we battled them, though out of them only about twenty or so wore masks. What I do know is that when I first saw the ogres that they numbered over fifty. After the battle there was only nine of them with me when we made our escape. This isn't to say that all the other ogres were killed though and I wonder what cruel end they met at the hands of those fanatics we had left them in.[/i]

Unlike the other zealots, I could remember some of the words that came from the halfling on that battlefield. 'I should have killed you', 'a mistake to spare me', and so forth. All of a sudden though the halfling stopped talking as I felt something deep within me come out, and overwhelming hatred that I seemed to channel into the halfling's body. While this happened, I took my other arm and raised the axe high, bringing down its backside on the halflings shoulder in an effort to escape his grip. I could feel the power of the blow as it connected, the force of the impact reverberating through both of our bodies. I could hear the halfling clench its teeth, feeling the pain from the blow, before I was quickly thrown to the ground.

Almost immediately I got up, with feelings full of violence that I was ready to unleash. I don't know what happened next but I immediately remember striking the halflings back, somehow seemingly moving around in an instant. A howl of pain erupted from the halfling as the blow connected. The halfling attempted to jab at me furiously in response, but I simply used my free hand to knock away the meager blows, before beginning to make an all out assault. Blow after blow struck my prey, leaving deep gashes in the halflings armor. At this point I could remember the grin on my face tearing at my face muscles in an unnatural way and the hatred within me unleashing with every blow.

The halfling not amused by my attacks attempted to strike back with a series of kicks. I remember receiving several hits to my body though feeling little from them. I immediately swiped back at the halfling, though the blow was easily dodged, before a fury of punches were released against me. Annoyed now I retaliated wildly with a slash of the axe, relishing the scream unleashed into the air by the halfling as my attack connected, cutting deep through the leather armor into the flesh underneath. At this point the halfling began to cough up blood, suffering greatly from the inflicted wound. I could feel my hatred burning within the halfling now, tearing at the insides from the wound I had just inflicted. It was an intoxicating feeling.

My emotions completely enveloped me at that point as I began to swing by axe relentlessly with little care of what I hit. The halfling tried to dodge my blows but a number of them hit home. Blood flew as I sliced at the halfling, and possibly some other fanatics that unfortunately happened into my path. Finally having enough of this the halfling made a swift move in the other direction, to get away from me, attempting to escape the retribution that I was bringing forth. The halfling dropped close to the ground, the injuries I had rendered now taking their toll. I could hear murmuring around me too, noticing all the fanatics, both initiates and zealots, backing away.

Thinking about what I should do next, I felt a large hand on my shoulder, turning me about so I could see the face of the ogre strategist. Talking quickly, the strategist relayed to me in a winded voice, "We can't linger here anymore, the other zealots behind us are closing in, we need to push through and get out of here." Looking behind me, I could see the figures approaching rapidly, a far larger group and likely much better armed and armored, as the light flickered off the wall of metal coming for us. However, looking ahead I saw only a handful of initiates and zealots left, and knew that if we broke through them then at least those ogres still fighting could get to safety.

I called out to the ogres to breakthrough now, before charging towards the terrified fanatics ahead of me. The remaining ogres who were still fighting saw this and began to rally, then move forward towards the freedom we sought. There was no resistance left to be found in the fanatics, their morale was completely broken. Some who couldn't scramble out of our way were trampled as we ran over them. Looking back at the battlefield I caught a glimpse of the halfling, who stared at me with a cold hatred, but at the same time could not do anymore. I could feel a bit of satisfaction rise within me, from snubbing the zealots, and for helping to at least get those ogres now with me away.

Many of the ogres had fallen during the battle, many killed by that halfling's hands. Some ogres remained on the battlefield, alive but too injured to follow; or too demoralized in the case of some, like that female ogre I had witnessed collapsed to the ground, left to the whims of those zealots. There was no way for us to retrieve them, the other group of zealots had already caught up and had begun their pursuit of us, and wouldn't stop chasing us for a long time. Even after they disappeared from view we continued to run for a long while. When we did stop it was only after one of the ogres had fallen down due to wounds inflicted in the recent battle.

Making my way over to the ogre I was quick to treat her wounds. The ogre commander had managed to survive the battle, though he also had injuries visible all over his body, and quickly came over to also be treated. The ogre strategist was quick to take charge at that point in the journey, telling me to only use the infusions enough to close their wounds so that we could get moving again. Eventually later on when we stopped again to gather our breath I would continue my treatment with my remaining infusions as best I could. After that we would run a distance, stop to rest, and run again several times. It felt as if we didn't stop running until after the sun became visible in the sky once more.]], [[[i]I'm not sure how big the fanatics’ group was when we battled them, though out of them only about twenty or so wore masks.

Blood flew as I sliced at the halfling, and possibly some other fanatics that unfortunately happened into my path. Finally having enough of this the halfling made a swift move in the other direction, to get away from me, attempting to escape the retribution that I was bringing forth. The halfling dropped close to the ground, the injuries I had rendered now taking their toll. I could hear murmuring around me too, noticing all the fanatics, both initiates and zealots, backing away.

Thinking about what I should do next, I felt a large hand on my shoulder, turning me about so I could see the face of the ogre strategist. Talking quickly, the strategist relayed to me in a winded voice, "We can't linger here anymore, the other zealots behind us are closing in, we need to push through and get out of here." Looking behind me, I could see the figures approaching rapidly, a far larger group and likely much better armed and armored, as the light flickered off the wall of metal coming for us. However, looking ahead I saw only a handful of initiates and zealots left, and knew that if we broke through them then at least those ogres still fighting could get to safety.

I called out to the ogres to breakthrough now, before charging towards the terrified fanatics ahead of me. The remaining ogres who were still fighting saw this and began to rally, then move forward towards the freedom we sought. There was no resistance left to be found in the fanatics, their morale was completely broken. Some who couldn't scramble out of our way were trampled as we ran over them. Looking back at the battlefield I caught a glimpse of the halfling, who stared at me with a cold hatred, but at the same time could not do anymore. I could feel a bit of satisfaction rise within me, from snubbing the zealots, and for helping to at least get those ogres now with me away.

Many of the ogres had fallen during the battle, many killed by that halfling's hands. Some ogres remained on the battlefield, alive but too injured to follow; or too demoralized in the case of some, like that female ogre I had witnessed collapsed to the ground, left to the whims of those zealots. There was no way for us to retrieve them, the other group of zealots had already caught up and had begun their pursuit of us, and wouldn't stop chasing us for a long time. Even after they disappeared from view we continued to run for a long while. When we did stop it was only after one of the ogres had fallen down due to wounds inflicted in the recent battle.

Making my way over to the ogre I was quick to treat her wounds. The ogre commander had managed to survive the battle, though he also had injuries visible all over his body, and quickly came over to also be treated. The ogre strategist was quick to take charge at that point in the journey, telling me to only use the infusions enough to close their wounds so that we could get moving again. Eventually later on when we stopped again to gather our breath I would continue my treatment with my remaining infusions as best I could. After that we would run a distance, stop to rest, and run again several times. It felt as if we didn't stop running until after the sun became visible in the sky once more.]], "_t")

t([[[i]The endurance of an ogre is quite astonishing. While I had collapsed from exhaustion, the ogres had persevered and managed to stay awake until we made it to an abandoned settlement. In particular, while many of the ogres had managed to acquire some sleep along with me, the commander and strategist would manage to make the entire journey to Elvala before they would finally collapse from exhaustion. I honestly don't believe any other race could possibly stay awake, let alone active, for that long.[/i]

I don't know how long I had spent within that hellish shoreline; perhaps days or even a week. It was good to see some semblance of greenery and living nature again as we proceeded to head into the area just south of the Nargol lands. I basked a little in the natural sunlight from the sky, before feeling the rumbling in my stomach, and the heavy weight of exhaustion from so much running. The ogres for their part did not seem the least bit tired or hungry, but after such a long travel I wondered if this was truly the case. Reaching for my pack I pulled out my provisions and laid them on the ground. Almost immediately I noticed the hungry stares from the ogres.

Have you ever seen a hungry ogre? Within an instant they will eat any food in front of them. I barely had time to get out of the way before the entire group of them converged on the tasty morsels that had come into their view. When I looked back next, I noticed that all the provisions I had laid out were gone, and the ogres were now rummaging through my backpack to see if they could find more. After failing to find any they adopted some semblance of civility once more. The commander got up and came over to thank me for the food and asked that I excuse himself and the others for their over eagerness. That didn't do anything for my own hunger but I'm glad they enjoyed filling their stomachs I guess.

From behind the strategist approached and clutched in his hand was one of the rations of food from my bag. Noticing it I quickly snatched at that food when he offered it and hungrily devoured it. Half of it had already been eaten, but considering how hungry I was I didn't really care. Both the commander and strategist seemed to chuckle at this. As they regained their composure though I could see the reality of the situation creep back into their faces. Once again I could see the dark blue glow appear over the eyes of commanders face as he looked in the direction of the southern shoreline. "Any sign of them?” the strategist asked. "No, but that doesn't mean we are in the clear,” the commander responded.

I don't remember much after that. I do recall that the commander and strategist talked to each other for a bit, but apparently during their conversation I passed out. When I woke up I was next to a campfire on a couple mattresses sandwiched between a couple of the ogres. Above the fire a skewered wolf was slowly being turned, and seeing me wake up, the ogre turning the spit called out that I was awake. Looking around I noticed several ogres soundly sleeping on various makeshift beds and chairs ranging from batches of grass on the ground and tables propped next to walls. I could tell that we were now in one of the abandoned Shaloren settlements, which made we wonder as to just how long I was out and what had happened since.

The commander and strategist then approached from behind one of the buildings. The strategist called out, "How are you doing thalore? Did you rest well?" I was a bit groggy from waking up but I replied back, "I'll rest better when we get to Elvala. What has happened?" To this I received a quick story, noting that we had arrived at the outskirts of Shaloren territory and that the ogres had carried me here after I had collapsed. Periodically from behind I could see the commander looking out in various directions with his vision rune, still on the lookout for any trouble. The strategist noted that what appeared to be scouts for the zealots had been following us, but hanging back far in the distance.

"We can't linger here much longer.” the strategist commented. Looking at the strategist I asked, "When will we be heading out next?" Before the strategist even had a chance to reply the commander boomed from behind him, "Immediately after you have had something to eat." I could tell from the commanders facial expressions that he was suggesting the meat cooking above the fireplace. I was a bit disgusted by the thought of this so I noted that I would go acquire my own food. The commander looked at me when I said this, pausing for a moment, but with a sigh he told me "be quick" before turning away and proceeding to rouse the sleeping ogres from their slumbering.

After a little while of searching through the nearby buildings I noticed a trapdoor with a rusty lock. Breaking it and descending a ladder I found a cellar, untouched since the time the original shaloren inhabitants had lived here. I found several bottles of wine as well as some old vegetables and dried fruit. I brushed away some cobwebs from a nearby chair and table to eat my fill, before carrying a bundle of vegetables and fruit back to the ogres campsite. The commander was already assembling the other ogres, and I could see that a couple of recently killed carcasses slung on their shoulders. Seeing me carrying food, the commander and strategist came over to help take the load and ask where I had found it.

I relayed to them the location of the cellar which I had found and its contents. The commander, while interested in acquiring food, was quite disinterested in the fact that it was located in a shaloren cellar. Concerned with the time it would take to bring it up, he noted that an ogre wouldn't be able to easily fit through any of the doors in the settlement here, let alone a trap door to one of the cellars. The strategist though noted that I had fit through and insisted that we take the food to ensure that there was enough to eat for the remainder of our journey. The commander was hesitant at staying any longer but consented. After spending another hour I was able to bring up all the food before we continued on towards Elvala.   ]], [[[i]The endurance of an ogre is quite astonishing.

We continued deeper into Shaloren territory, the fanatics’ scouts continuing to follow us but always careful to stay back and never stray too close. It would be a couple more days before we reached the edge of the Shroud. Navigating to where I had first crossed through the misty wall to get into the city, I reached into my pack to retrieve the Rune of Return that I had received so long ago. With an outstretched hand I presented it to the ogre commander. I had expected him to take it but he simply nodded his head and noted, "A Rune of Return." For the next brief moment I stood there with my hand held out, the commander seemingly as puzzled as I was to our interaction. It wasn't clear until the strategist finally chimed in, "You have no clue how that rune your holding works do you?"

At this the commander blinked before realizing the situation and noting, "Right, you’re a complete novice." I could feel the blank expression worn on my face and the ogres were seemingly aware of this. "Come over here thalore," a voice called out. I turned my head to see who was calling me, before noting it was a female ogre that I had helped from before, "let's see that rune you got." I was a bit confused, but I made my way over and presented the rune. Taking it in one hand, she proceeded to examine the rune, before handing it back to me. “Right," the ogre began, "this here rune is bonded to you, so only you can inscribe it. After that is done you can use the rune to enter Elvala and request entry for us."

It felt like the words popping out of the ogres mouth were some type of different language. The ogre who I would eventually come to know as my instructor gave a series of explanations about runes, though eventually decided it would just be better to graft the Rune of Return on me instead of giving me a lesson on rune theory. To ensure that I would have the least trouble activating the rune, the ogre chose to graft it on my back just below my neck. I can remember how painful the experience was as the nerves in the back of my spine were pricked and prodded at. Despite the pain though, I can also remember the exhilaration my body felt as it was touched by arcane forces for the first time.

"There then, finished." Pleased with her work, the ogre circled around me to put her hands on my shoulders. "Now, all that is left for you to do is for you to get pass this barrier and make the request for our entry. Thalore, before I tell you what to do to activate the rune, know that I thank you for helping to bring us this far. If it hadn't been for you, I- we ogres... we likely would have all died." I could see the tears beginning to stream down the face of the ogre as she continued "Once again it seems our lives are in your hands. I hope that you will be able to convince the Shaloren to let us in, but even if you can't I wanted to thank you, we all want to thank you." Around me I could see the other ogres bowing their heads.

With a smile I replied back "I'm sure you will be let in. Tell me what it is I need to do." Raising her head while wiping away the tears from her face, I was walked through the process to activate the rune. I gave a solemn nod to the ogres before performing the steps myself. Within an instant my surroundings completely changed as I could hear the bustling of shaloren all around me. I could feel a heavy sensation on my neck where the rune had been inscribed, but other than that I felt no different. A few of the shalore turned to look in my direction, seemingly surprised at my entry, though not as much as I would have expected. One of the shalore soon called out, "You're that thalore who helped us from before? Welcome back!"

"Oh, a, thank you" I replied back, slowly adjusting to the fact that I had abruptly entered Elvala. Quickly, I realized that the ogre's were still outside of Elvala waiting for me. Excusing myself, I proceeded to run to the middle of the town where I had previously met the general. As before there stood guards outside the building, though they recognized me as I approached. Panting and out of breath I took a brief moment to inhale and exhale before gasping out "Ogres... seeking asylum... here in... Elvala." The guards in front of me stood in bewilderment after hearing the sentence I let out, seemingly grasping what I had said but unable to determine what to do.

Then from behind me came a voice, "What is this about ogres?" I turned around to see a young female shalore, who I recognized as being one of the mages who saw me off from Elvala. Seeing me, she seemed to oddly cool a bit and address me saying "Ooo, you're that thalore. We've never personally met but I helped teleport you out of Elvala a short while ago. Welcome back to Elvala." Catching my breathe I explained the situation involving the ogres outside, the zealots chasing them, and how they were looking to seek refuge in Elvala. As I finished talking the young shalore stated, "Judging from what you have told me, it would likely be best if those ogre's were brought in quickly."

Approaching the guards to communicate something, their bewildered faces quickly became somewhat distressed both by the actions and words of the shalore woman. I don't know what the mage had said, but it seemed as if the guards were almost pleading with the young shaloren woman about something. Eventually she called for me to follow her and began to move in the direction I had come when I entered the city with the Rune of Return. I could tell that this shalore seemed to have some plan in mind, perhaps one that would allow the ogres passage into the city.

t([[[i]Alreiwen Taeil the foolhardy enchantress. Easily the worst conversationalist I have ever met, and among all the shaloren I know of none that has a greater ego than hers. Still, I respect her sense of justice as well as her gifted abilities in the arcane. Who knows what fate may have happened to the ogres had she not been present when I made the request for their entry.[/i]

Along the way the young mage probed me with varying questions relating to my travels and the events that I had witnessed or been a part of. Of those questions asked though, the ones involving the treatment of the ogres have stuck out in my mind the most. "So the ogres, I've heard a little bit about them. While they never really traveled here to Elvala, I've heard stories of their altruism and heroics. But, from what you told me about those crazed lunatics, it seems rather odd that they wouldn't have killed the ogres outright. I mean they have obviously managed to merge their bodies with arcane runes, what more reason is there for someone who hates magic to just kill them then and there. For what purpose do you think they would be kept alive?"

I responded coldly to the question, "I do not know the reason, nor do I care. For what purpose would you attempt to discern any meaning from their mad actions anyways? I see little reason for you or any shalore to care." Laughing at this, the young shalore replied "perhaps you are right, but just because these 'cultists' seem to act mad to you, doesn't mean that they pursue whatever their doctrines are aimlessly. They will be our enemies for sure in the future, but hopefully before we ever truly encounter them we can at least know their motives. If we can understand how they act, we can understand what moves they will make, and we can make plans to counter their schemes as a result."

Continuing on, I noticed that the shalore was intently looking at me, or rather at the back of my neck. "Judging from where the rune I crafted was placed, I guess the ogres helped you with inscribing my Rune of Return?" Taking a moment to process what the shalore said, I soon spouted, "You crafted?" The shalore smiled and laughed a bit before continuing, "Indeed I did, a masterwork produced by the best enchantress in Elvala! Though I'm wondering why you didn't graft it on to your own skin yourself, or are the Thaloren really 'that' backwards when it comes to the arcane?" I remember the cold expression I gave, which she immediately picked up on before replying, "Right, I'll try to keep that in mind the next time I meet a thalore."

Nearing the outer edges of Elvala where the Shroud was, the enchantress asked where exactly the ogres would be. I noted to her that I had left them in the same place where I had entered through the Shroud on my first visit, and promptly led her to that spot of my initial entry. Standing stoically, she raised her arms and seemed to sing in a low harmonic sound, and almost immediately the misty smoke began to part. Any skepticism I had as to what she planned was soon replaced with astonishment as a tunnel smaller in size than the one I had traversed formed in front us. From the other side of the tunnel I could see the distant figures of the ogres appear.

Not missing a beat, I could see the ogres begin to move towards us. After a few minutes the first of them began to run inside Elvala's walls before collapsing to the ground. Behind us I noticed a growing crowd of onlookers gathering to witness the unexpected event in front of them. As the last ogre exited from the tunnel, the mage put her arms down, and with it the Shroud fell as well. Finished, she too fell backwards to the ground and gasped heavily for air, seemingly drained of of all her energy after the amazing feat. Looking up at me with a smile on her face she made a simple statement in between deep breaths, "It is done. You have led the ogres to their safety."

"Indeed, though this wasn't the proper way to go about it.” I heard a voice state behind me. Turning around to see the general, I quickly noticed the large company of guards breaking through the onlookers and making our way towards us. For a moment I wondered if there would be trouble, but the general eventually gave the order to the soldiers to help carry the ogres to the healers. As the general began to approach the enchantress his eyes seem to dart quickly towards me. Stopping for a moment to give me a quick look over, he stated in a quiet but authoritative voice, "You should head over with the ogres as well.” before continuing on past me towards the enchantress. Standing above the young shalore as she slowly caught her breathe, I could see him fold his arms.

Deciding for now it would be best to follow the orders of the general, I proceeded to make my way to Elvala's medical facilities as well. Naively thinking I would look for the chief healer and see how I could help out, I made my way into the building, and asked the closest healer where I could find him. I can still remember the shock on the face of the healer's face, as it hadn't even occurred to me at that time that the general had suggested that I head to the healers for my own injuries, not for those of the ogres. It didn't take long for what seemed like one healer after another to be called over, before it seemed like half of the healers in the building were tending to me, including some of those that were originally tending to the ogres.

I can't say I remembered much of what happened either, I couldn't even remember feeling any pain for any of the injuries I apparently had, though the healers recognized how critical those injuries were. I was promptly whisked away to one of the empty beds and given several anesthetic infusions, which subsequently caused me to black out. I would learn later that the healers were aghast at how brutally injured I truly was, but were truly horrified when the regenerative infusions they applied seemingly failed to have much effect, despite how many they applied. It would take my body a few months to recover, not to mention countless infusions. Even to this day I am told to be careful of injury due to how long it takes for me to heal.

Eventually when I woke up, and after the healers had checked me over, I was told to wait as someone wished to visit me. After a period of time I was greeted by the enchantress once more. "I see you are doing alright, you’re certainly quite tough thalore. Don't worry about the ogres, Aranion has granted them the asylum here as requested." She spoke proudly though I could sense a hint of disappointment in her voice. "Now then, I realize you have only woken up, but Aranion wants me to get the story from you as to what transpired after you had left for the Nargol Kingdom to the point when you came back to Elvala. Perhaps as well you might shed some light on why exactly it took you so long to heal as well?"  ]], [[[i]Alreiwen Taeil the foolhardy enchantress. Easily the worst conversationalist I have ever met, and among all the shaloren I know of none that has a greater ego than hers. Still, I respect her sense of justice as well as her gifted abilities in the arcane. Who knows what fate may have happened to the ogres had she not been present when I made the request for their entry.[/i]

Along the way the young mage probed me with varying questions relating to my travels and the events that I had witnessed or been a part of. Of those questions asked though, the ones involving the treatment of the ogres have stuck out in my mind the most. "So the ogres, I've heard a little bit about them. While they never really traveled here to Elvala, I've heard stories of their altruism and heroics. But, from what you told me about those crazed lunatics, it seems rather odd that they wouldn't have killed the ogres outright. I mean they have obviously managed to merge their bodies with arcane runes, what more reason is there for someone who hates magic to just kill them then and there. For what purpose do you think they would be kept alive?"

I responded coldly to the question, "I do not know the reason, nor do I care. For what purpose would you attempt to discern any meaning from their mad actions anyways? I see little reason for you or any shalore to care." Laughing at this, the young shalore replied "perhaps you are right, but just because these 'cultists' seem to act mad to you, doesn't mean that they pursue whatever their doctrines are aimlessly. They will be our enemies for sure in the future, but hopefully before we ever truly encounter them we can at least know their motives. If we can understand how they act, we can understand what moves they will make, and we can make plans to counter their schemes as a result."

Continuing on, I noticed that the shalore was intently looking at me, or rather at the back of my neck. "Judging from where the rune I crafted was placed, I guess the ogres helped you with inscribing my Rune of Return?" Taking a moment to process what the shalore said, I soon spouted, "You crafted?" The shalore smiled and laughed a bit before continuing, "Indeed I did, a masterwork produced by the best enchantress in Elvala! Though I'm wondering why you didn't graft it on to your own skin yourself, or are the Thaloren really 'that' backwards when it comes to the arcane?" I remember the cold expression I gave, which she immediately picked up on before replying, "Right, I'll try to keep that in mind the next time I meet a thalore."

Nearing the outer edges of Elvala where the Shroud was, the enchantress asked where exactly the ogres would be. I noted to her that I had left them in the same place where I had entered through the Shroud on my first visit, and promptly led her to that spot of my initial entry. Standing stoically, she raised her arms and seemed to sing in a low harmonic sound, and almost immediately the misty smoke began to part. Any skepticism I had as to what she planned was soon replaced with astonishment as a tunnel smaller in size than the one I had traversed formed in front us. From the other side of the tunnel I could see the distant figures of the ogres appear.

Not missing a beat, I could see the ogres begin to move towards us. After a few minutes the first of them began to run inside Elvala's walls before collapsing to the ground. Behind us I noticed a growing crowd of onlookers gathering to witness the unexpected event in front of them. As the last ogre exited from the tunnel, the mage put her arms down, and with it the Shroud fell as well. Finished, she too fell backwards to the ground and gasped heavily for air, seemingly drained of of all her energy after the amazing feat. Looking up at me with a smile on her face she made a simple statement in between deep breaths, "It is done. You have led the ogres to their safety."

"Indeed, though this wasn't the proper way to go about it.” I heard a voice state behind me. Turning around to see the general, I quickly noticed the large company of guards breaking through the onlookers and making our way towards us. For a moment I wondered if there would be trouble, but the general eventually gave the order to the soldiers to help carry the ogres to the healers. As the general began to approach the enchantress his eyes seem to dart quickly towards me. Stopping for a moment to give me a quick look over, he stated in a quiet but authoritative voice, "You should head over with the ogres as well.” before continuing on past me towards the enchantress. Standing above the young shalore as she slowly caught her breathe, I could see him fold his arms.

Deciding for now it would be best to follow the orders of the general, I proceeded to make my way to Elvala's medical facilities as well. Naively thinking I would look for the chief healer and see how I could help out, I made my way into the building, and asked the closest healer where I could find him. I can still remember the shock on the face of the healer's face, as it hadn't even occurred to me at that time that the general had suggested that I head to the healers for my own injuries, not for those of the ogres. It didn't take long for what seemed like one healer after another to be called over, before it seemed like half of the healers in the building were tending to me, including some of those that were originally tending to the ogres.

I can't say I remembered much of what happened either, I couldn't even remember feeling any pain for any of the injuries I apparently had, though the healers recognized how critical those injuries were. I was promptly whisked away to one of the empty beds and given several anesthetic infusions, which subsequently caused me to black out. I would learn later that the healers were aghast at how brutally injured I truly was, but were truly horrified when the regenerative infusions they applied seemingly failed to have much effect, despite how many they applied. It would take my body a few months to recover, not to mention countless infusions. Even to this day I am told to be careful of injury due to how long it takes for me to heal.

While it was but a mere moment, I could tell that all my rage had been channeled into her very being, the same rage that I had filled those fanatics with from before. At that moment I could tell she knew how potentially dangerous I was. Rei, if you are reading this then know how truly sorry I am for what happened.[/i]

For the next two hours, the enchantress proceeded to grill me as to what had happened after I had left Elvala. In great detail I informed her of my experiences within the Nargol Kingdom, and my subsequent travel along the southern shoreline of Maj'Eyal. Every so often the inquisitive shalore would ask me questions about the fanatics I had witnessed and the events I had seen them carry out or suspected them of having a part in. To be honest I couldn't tell if it was for her own satisfaction or perhaps if Aranion had indeed asked her in hopes of learning more about the fanatics. Eventually as our conversation came to a close, that was perhaps when the more eventful part of our discussion came up.

"So, that mostly concludes more or less what Aranion sent me here for,” she began, before continuing to state, "however, the healers also wanted me to ask you a few questions in regards to your body. I'm not sure if you have been told yet, but you have been in this hospital bed for several months now, despite injuries that should have healed in a few weeks. You wouldn't perhaps have an explanation for why this is?" Immediately I wondered if perhaps what had happened on that charred battlefield was connected with the slow recovery time of my body as I had finally begun to realize that something was wrong with me by that point. I can't say I was too interested in talking about that instance, not wanting to remember what had happened either.

"I wouldn't know why that would be.” I replied as I turned my head to look away from the enchantress. Despite not being able to see the shalore's face, I could immediately tell that she saw through me immediately. "So you do have some idea then.” she cheerfully responded. I glanced at her in disgust, noticing a gleam of satisfaction beaming from her eyes, although I couldn't tell what she would be satisfied from. "I'm also guessing that it somehow involves your recent fighting experience, judging from your reactions." I couldn't help but dart my eyes away, realizing that was only telling her how easily and accurately she was reading me. She seemed to giggle a little bit at this, which only served to annoy me and wish that she would go away more.

"The ogres I spoke to talked at great length about how you had led them here to Elvala, of how without your help they would likely not have survived in the fight against their pursuers. However, the more we spoke, the more it became clear that something was amiss. Curiously no ogre would say much in regards to you in whatever battle it was that you fought, despite how important you were to apparently winning it. From what I can understand there were many ogres with you too. How were you so paramount in the ogres getting here? I heard from the Rangers that you held your own against a couple of wolves, but armed fighters are clearly a step above some hungry animals, and you don't strike me as having much in the way of combat experience."

The enchantress intently examined me as she spoke, analyzing me for any hint or clue I would give her. For my part I was actively attempting to repress my memories of those recent events, to not relive the mix of emotions that had taken hold of me at that time, to leave them silent. Intent on digging further into me though, the enchantress continued to press on, to meet that darker version of myself. "What is it that you are hiding about yourself, that the ogres seemingly wouldn't mention about you? What unmentionable thing did you perhaps do to help the ogres through their plight?" The enchantress continued on with the probing questions one after the other, endlessly, never stopping, until finally I decided that she needed to stop.

"CEASE ASKING ME THESE QUESTIONS NOW!" The phrase swiftly escaped from me, though I had no intention of stating it as abruptly or forcefully as I did. The young shalore was immediately taken aback from my statement, her eyes widened and the smile that one could mistake for a permanent fixture on her face now gone. She began to shiver and sweat profusely all at once before stammering out "Wha-What?" She shook in her chair, and I could feel fear emanating from her body. I paused again for a moment, feeling a sense of satisfaction. This sensation I felt, it felt similar from something before. And then I realized all at once what was happening. My emotions were beginning to take a hold of me once more.

Immediately I pulled every force of my being away from the enchantress. She instantly jumped out of the chair and scrambled away from me, gasping as the pressure I had exerted was lifted. Her eyes were wide now, catching a full glimpse of the darker me, and she wanted nothing more than to actively hide away. "I'm sorry" was all I could muster to say. She looked at me, seemingly now appearing much older than before. Shakily she made her way to the door to leave the room, to get to safety, to get away from me. Sometime after she was gone I would realize that a guard would be stationed outside my room, and I'm pretty sure that guard was not there before the enchantress had come.

Eventually as I recovered enough to move around a bit I was finally released from the care of the healers. I was given a dwelling in a secluded part of Elvala and a pair of guards were stationed outside of it at all times. Although I never asked, I was sure they were there to confine me from the rest of the citizens of Elvala, and them from me. I didn't blame the shaloren for this as even now I could feel something driving me, influencing my thoughts, wanting to lash out. Who knows what sort of actions I might have been pushed to do, or whether I may have gone into a mad killing rage against the Shaloren; the irony of which is not lost on me considering my initial reasons for leaving Thaloren lands so long ago.]], [[[i]I do not know if Alreiwen has forgiven me, for the terror I had inflicted on her, or the hatred within me she must have felt.

t([[[i]It is worth noting that there were many ogres in Elvala after my long period of seclusion, hundreds of them even. Apparently the ogres I had rescued had petitioned the Grand Council to seek out as many of their fellow ogres as they could and help them before they were all killed. Agreeing to the request, contact was made with the Nargol Kingdom as well as some Human Kingdoms in the Northwest of Maj'Eyal to secretly help relocate as many of the ogres that could be found to the shrouded Shaloren lands.[/i]

As I finished fully recovering from my injuries, that was truly when I felt I was at the lowest point in my life. Having all the time in the world to think, I could not stop myself from remembering the events that had happened since that day when the Spellblaze occurred up to the present moment. Every waking minute felt as if I was dreaming, whether I was asleep or awake, yet this nightmare was real and deep within I could feel the urges that I had felt afflicting me when I fought against the fanatics trying to claw their way to the surface now. I was in a state of indescribable agony, seemingly hating more and more about my life, yet having no clue how to free myself from either my emotions or the cage I had been put in.

It wasn't until a few months had passed when a visitor would come to see me. I could hear outside the guards talking to someone, and from the distinctly deeper tone of the voice I figured it must have been one of the ogres. After a moment the guards let my visitor in and I immediately recognized the ogre strategist as he entered. With a solemn face he began to speak, "How are you then, thalore? It took some time but I was finally granted permission to meet with you. Likely if it wasn't for you we ogres would certainly all be dead now, or worse. We never got to properly thank you for saving us after you lead us to safety here in Elvala, and yet while we you freed from imprisonment, we perhaps led to you to your own."

As the strategist spoke those last words he paused to bow his head, and I could sense every ounce of his sadness in that brief moment. Regaining his previous composure though, the strategist raised his head once more to speak, "We figured we would have a celebration for everyone. After all that has happened, everyone is in need of a good dose of cheer to take our minds off everything." Finishing the first sentence the ogre looked at me, as if to add one important addition to it, "And from what I have heard, you need something to take your mind off past events as well." I had barely clued in that I was receiving anything more than gratitude from the strategist, but upon hearing that I realized I was being invited to a gathering of people.

Would 'I' be okay I thought? Could I potentially lash out again at someone? "I don't know if that would be a good idea..." I trailed off, hoping my uneasiness would be conveyed and not any of the anger or other emotions that bubbled inside me. Seeing it instead as a moment to speak the ogre chimed in, "Because you don't know if you will be able to control yourself and have another incident like with that enchantress?" Taken a bit off guard by this, my eyes grew wide. Yet the strategist said nothing, continuing to stand there with the same solemn face that he had entered with. Recovering from his statement I turned away as I stated, "I don't want to hurt anybody. It would probably be better if I stayed away, the less contact I have with anyone the better."

My words perhaps hit me the hardest when I said them. I hadn't realized it until that moment since I had been busy trying to keep a handle on myself but I was talking as if I was ready to become a recluse. I had spent three months here lamenting my situation, and yet now I was pushing away a chance to free myself from it? All at once I immediately began to feel hate, hatred similar to all the unfortunate incidents I had been a part of. But unlike before where I had directed my hatred at others, I had no one to feel hatreds towards here- "Except yourself?" I blanked for a moment when the ogre said those two words, seemingly connecting with my thoughts as perfectly as they did. I didn't know if it was a good idea or not but for a brief moment the hatred I felt within me faded.

Getting up and looking at the strategist I firmly stated, "I accept your offer." The ogre strategist seemed to become ecstatic at this, immediately taking my arm, and making way to the door. I couldn't decide if I was perhaps being led or simply dragged by the overly enthusiastic ogre to wherever the festivities were, but I certainly felt happier at that point than I had been in a long while. In the back of my mind I thought that if there was a chance for my condition to improve, it would perhaps be through the interaction with others. At the very least it was a way out of my seclusion and perhaps I could get my mind off of the many past events that were now haunting me.

Drawing closer to one of Elvala's main fields I could hear the voices and sounds of rhythmic beating up ahead, and I could see a gathering crowd of both shalore and ogre. Attentive faces were fixed on a group of a dozen ogres in the middle of the part. Observing the ogres, I noticed that they were performing a very slow, synchronized, and captivating dance. Those viewing the ogres seemed to be in little spirit, yet as the ogres continued to perform, gradually picking up the pace of their performance. Little by little the ogres would move faster before they encourage the crowd to join them by clapping. Slowly as those around began to clap the mood of the crowd began to improve until I could see smiles cracking from a few of their faces.

As the ogres finished their dance, a couple shalore decided to step forward and entertain the crowds. One began to sing a pleasing chord and then stop, then the other began to sing the same chord but at a lower frequency. Upon finishing the second chord, both shalore began to sing their chords, harmonizing them to produce a beautiful melody that washed over the crowd. Within myself, it felt as if I could hear nothing but my own thoughts for once. As the performances continued I felt as if I was regaining pieces of myself that I had once lost. Without a doubt, the affliction that had taken a hold of me was still there, but with each moment it felt less and less significant. For the first time in a long while I felt happiness, and even as the festivities died down and ended I continued to feel happy.

Making my way back to my dwelling I felt in control of myself and my actions. Whatever the enigma within me was, it did not and would not lord over me. As I came up to the guards I smiled and gave a friendly gesture. While I was heading back in for now, I knew that I would leave this dwelling again tomorrow. While the ogres are quick to note that I had saved them when conversation touches on past events, in reality I believe that they were the ones who had actually saved me. The ogres are quick to dismiss this as modesty, but since that time when I was at that festival I have been working to gain full control over my myself, to take a hold of my life once more.

t([[[i]As time passed, both ogre and shalore slowly adapted to their secluded lives from the outside world.[/i] The shaloren slowly gathered themselves and their belongings in secret from the abandoned settlements in the north, and then quickly worked to create permanent implements that would ensure that the Shroud concealing Elvala would stay in place. They then worked to expand the Shroud to encompass all the forests surrounding Elvala and lock off the Shaloren Peninsula from the outside world. After that, many shaloren began to study the chaotic energies that had been unleashed in hopes of learning more about the damage they had caused and what effects it would leave in Eyal.

[i]The ogres settled down in the southern portions of the peninsula to rebuild new lives for themselves.[/i] They helped to grow and harvest food to feed everyone and took up more laborious occupations that the shaloren were ill-suited to perform. Many gave birth to children, resulting in a great many young ogres helping to bolster their limited numbers. Some of the ogres also took up occupations working with inscriptions, and while my knowledge of runes is still quite limited, I could tell from their workmanship that their knowledge and skills with infusions were as good as many of the thaloren I knew back home. Despite some disagreements the ogres had, they managed to create a thriving relationship with the shaloren, one that I hope will last for a long time to come.

[i]In regards to myself, I want to one day leave Elvala and venture back out into the world.[/i] I know though that if I was to leave I would need to know how to properly defend myself, in case I ever ran into those fanatics or some other foul group that would seek to cause myself or others harm. I also wished to learn about the rune magic that the ogres had used, and whether it could be something I myself may want to employ. Finally I couldn't ignore the nagging affliction which influences me, as I knew that if I ever lost control and had my emotions consume me once more that I may lash out against those who I did not mean to. With this in mind I sought the help of those around me, looking to learn whatever they may teach me.

I was surprised to find that when approached about this, both the shaloren and the ogres were quite willing to teach me. Back home few were interested in sharing their knowledge with others for any reason, and this included even between family members. The exception to this of course was where a necessity to Thaloren society existed, such as in times of war or other calamity, but even then it was limited. I will note though that the shaloren I approached tended to request something in exchange for teaching me, usually asking for monetary compensation. The ogres on the other hand that I talked too were quite open in sharing their knowledge, and in fact one in particular seemed almost overly eager to do so.

This was when my instructor, the female ogre who had helped graft my Rune of Return on my neck, approached me offering to give me a full breakdown on the use of runes and their applications. I was told about the variety of runes that existed and the various abilities they could employ. I also learned about the basics of their use, being lectured on how they would gather a bodies innate inner magic into arcane energy, convert that arcane energy into the magical effect that the rune would employ, and need time to repeat the process again. On top of this a rune would create a magical buildup within the body which would make subsequent rune use more and more difficult for the user to do.

My instructor was also keen to give me a hands on demonstration regarding the use of runes to ensure I truly understood how they would work. I remember when we first started out how she abruptly disappeared from in front of me, how I subsequently looked around aimlessly before hearing her laugh in front of me as she reappeared again. I would be introduced to several ogres who would show me the multitude of abilities that their runes would grant them and hear stories of how they had used their runes in past scuffles or brawls. Finally, my instructor offered to give me a rune for my own personal use, a heat beam rune. Unlike how my instructor had grafted the Rune of Return onto me before, I inscribe that rune onto my left arm myself, and it is still with me to this day.

From the shaloren I would learn various skills, specifically in regards combat equipment. A weaponsmith gave me some rudimentary lessons on how to wield and orient a weapon in combat before getting me to practice for hitting training dummies with everything from large swords and hammers to small daggers and clubs. From an armorsmith I was shown various pieces of clothing and armor and shown the varying effectiveness these armors had when hit with weapons. I even got to run a small training course decked out in full set of plate armor that the armorsmith lent me to learn how to maneuver and run around without completely exhausting myself.

Eventually some veteran shaloren soldiers offered to spar with me too. From that moment I took everything that I had learned and put it all into practice. For a time I would engage in mock battles, learning how to regulate my stamina and when to use runes to give myself and advantage in combat, or just to make up for disadvantages that I might be suffering. It wasn't long before I could hold my own in combat even against battle hardened trained soldiers, at which point I was promptly asked if I would be interested in enlisting in the Shaloren Military. Not having much to do and figuring it would help in advancing my combat skills I accepted, and for several years I would serve as a soldier in Elvala.

It would also be within the military that I would get to learn a great deal about controlling my emotions. Enrolled in a program for those with unique abilities, I would slowly begin to learn more about the dark condition affecting my body and how I could use it to my advantage. I would learn about how I could effect my surroundings, both inanimate and living, and in some cases I would even be allowed to practice trying to use the dark thoughts inside me against others. I can't say I ever gained full control over the chaotic energies within me, but through concentration I would learn how to at least direct it away from others and prevent it from affecting people in my vicinity.

When I look back at the many events the occurred after the Spellblaze, I wonder what life might have held for me had I not left to travel as I did. Much time has now passed since the time of my initial journey, but I consider whether now is the time that I will leave Elvala to explore distant lands and see what has become of everything in the world. I wonder how the rest of the people in Eyal are faring and whether the lands have shown any signs of healing, as well as wonder what has happened to my fellow thaloren back home.

Casting your eyes upon them you will be presented with a truly horrible display as you witness rows of hanging flesh and dripping puss surrounding a vaguely humanoid figure. The worst of it though is the touch and feel of ghouls. I bet any ordinary individual would feel grossly unsettled just poking them with a stick, let alone engaging up close to them in combat as I did.[/i]

As I walked along the treeline I recounted the events that had led me to these daily patrols. Thirty-three long years passed after the cataclysm of the Spellblaze, the moment still burning within my mind, as well as my body. I survived the destruction and the events that followed, and had come to find myself in Elvala among the shaloren, whom I had come to care for and be in the care of. I had fallen in love with one of the soldiers whom I had trained with and had come to know him as family. Yet I wondered how the rest outside of Elvala suffered, how those thaloren at home fared, and if I should leave to explore the world again as I had once desired too.

Returning from my patrol towards the old path that cut through the forest I noticed a couple of Elvala's officials and a cadre of guards in the distance. Approaching them I soon noticed what looked to be a rotting body at their feet. Glancing towards the body I felt a coldness, a dark force that felt worse than anything I had every experienced, including the chaotic energies within me. Catching sight of me, one of the officials turned towards me and stated in a direct voice, "Fay, I need you to quickly exit through the Shroud, take a quick look around, and report back anything unusual you see." Sensing some urgency to this request I promptly turned towards the Shroud and dove in without a second thought.

Traveling through the misty smoke I recalled the first time I had left Elvala. I had traveled through this magical barrier many times to rescue those who had found themselves stranded outside the wall or to act as an escort for Nargol emissary's and traders, but I could feel as though there was a great tension around me. For the next two hours I slowly traversed through the smoke with only my thoughts to keep my company until at last I reached the other side and began to see the outside world ahead begin to unfurl itself. Nearing the outer edges of the smoke I heard a guttural sound bellow out nearby, before I glimpsed a gaunt figure jumped over towards me, swinging its arms in my direction.

Unable to immediately dodge the attack, one of the arms connected with my chest, hitting me with immense strength. The strike reverberated through my steel breastplate, shaking the whole of my body, and throwing me completely off balance. Seemingly not missing a beat the creature threw its face towards my arm, clamping down hard with its teeth, and somehow biting through my steel gauntlets. Pain seared through my left arm, and something more seemed to course through my body, sapping my strength and making me sluggish. It did not know who this attacker was but I could feel the hatred inside me beginning to build. All that was left to do was to unleash it.

Beginning to counterattack I activated the heat beam rune in my left hand. The creature quickly detached from my arm and began to cry out as flames engulfed all around it. Immediately following this I began to hit the creature with a fury of blows that quickly overwhelmed the creature as it flailed widely in an attempt to attack back. Pressing my advantage I struck the creature with a devastating swipe that cut hard across its body. I paused for a moment as I expected the creature to keel over dead, but was surprised when the creature seemed to bounce back and try one more time to attack me. I dodged this attack with ease though and with a simple slash I partially separated its head from its body, finally killing it.

Finally having a chance to closely examine the creature, I noticed a single eye staring out from one of the eye sockets. Blinking and looking at the rest of its body I realized I had been fighting a rotting corpse. I wondered if there were anymore undead and I began to look around my immediate area. Around me I could spot a few sparse dead corpses mingling about that had yet to notice my presence. Deciding I would dispatch them I attempted to quietly approach them, only to realize how difficult this would be due to all the muddy ground in the area. It was at this point though when I wondered why all the ground was muddy, before I discerned the many tracks and footprints, all leading into the Shroud.

Realizing the danger that was headed to Elvala, I quickly activated the Rune of Return that I had been grafted by the ogres on my neck, and in an instant I was once again within the city walls. Before I could reacquire my bearings a shaloren soldier walked into me and knocked me to the ground. The soldier soon got to his feet saying "My apologies" and proceeded to extend a hand under my left shoulder to help me up. Noticing the festering bite marks on my arm, the eyes of the soldier soon gained a solemn look and continuing to talk stated, "Command will want your report immediately on the undead you encountered. We've had a few more wander in through the Shroud while you were scouting."

I turned towards the soldier who nodded in the direction of the main battlement line facing towards Elvala's northern forests. Nodding back, I proceeded to make my way to the tower above the main gate where I suspected the watch captain would be. I quickly made my way through the host of gathering soldiers forming below the walls and made my way up along with the mages and archers who were climbing the stairs to get to their positions. Noticing me as I made my way up, the watch captain called out in my direction, and I hurried over to his position to relay to him what had occurred. The captain tensed his face as I gave him my report and cursed as he turned his head to look out towards the Shroud.]], [[[i]Truly there is nothing more horrid than the experience of encountering ghouls.

t([[[i]Looking past the gruesome nature of the undead, I can somewhat appreciate the brilliance of the tactics and strategy that they employed.

This allowed the necromancer controlling them to stay safely out of harms way and away for the duration of the battle.[/i]

Suddenly I noticed the captain's eyes narrow and lock onto something within the smoke and turning to look myself I noticed the quivering distortions. Suddenly, with a loud call to "FIRE" coming from the watch captain, the many archers and mages began to loose arrows and cast spells, causing the disturbance to turn into a whirling maelstrom as projectiles and magic slammed into it. Despite the barrage a glistening phalanx of moving bones and tattered armor emerged, revealing several rows of skeletons in a defensive formation. Holding their shields high above them, they moved within lockstep of each other, and slowly made their approach towards the wall.

The defenders continued to unleash everything they could over the walls, but for every single skeleton that was shattered or had its bones scattered across the battlefield it seemed as if two more would emerge behind it. Being unliving enemies with no free will of their own they continued to advanced towards us no matter how many of them fell. Approaching the walls, soldiers from below began to cart up rocks and stones into great piles, and as the skeletons got closer the soldiers began to throw the debris over the walls. Unlike with arrows and spells, the skeletons could not overcome the heavy weight dropping down on them and many would be subsequently crushed.

Looking down at them, the captain seem to muse over the situation before muttering, "I don't see them carrying any ladders, but judging from how they marched to the walls they must have some plan." Continuing to monitor them, I noticed hoarse voices in the air, and all of a sudden nearby panicked voices from those on the wall began to call out that they were under attack. Looking around I couldn’t see any attackers but I could tell that there were foes nearby. Then all at once I could feel the faint presence of something moving behind me and the watch captain. Quickly pulling my weapon I slashed behind me at the space where one of them was and though I couldn't see the enemy I heard a low gasp as my weapon slashed through the air.

Becoming aware of what was happening, the watch captain called out to the defenders on the battlements, "We are under attack by shades, defend yourselves!" All at once everyone on the battlements turned to deal with the new threat and ignore the skeletons below. Those that could determine where the hidden enemies were quickly focused their attacks on dispatching the enemies directly while those that couldn't unleashed attacks in wide arcs that would be difficult to evade. It wasn't long before a torrent of death cries filled the air, but it would soon become clear that these enemies were just a distraction as skeletons made their move, constructing ladders and forming pyramids made of bones.

Now with means to get to us, the skeletons were clambering up and arriving onto the battlements, using their superior numbers to push us back. Seeing that we were being overwhelmed, the watch captain gave the order to abandon the walls, causing everyone to scramble in an attempt to get off in whatever way possible. Unfortunately in the confusion, many who were still engaged or injured were unable to get away, and were subsequently hacked to pieces. Having lost control of the battlements, a small force of the skeletons moved to take over the gates and allow for the rest of the undead outside to get in, while the rest of the skeletons began to jump off in pursuit of us in a bid to run us down.

As we ran down one of Elvala's narrow streets, the watch captain saw an opportunity present itself, and ordered the mages to form a firing line. Following us, the skeletons funneled into the streets after us into a tight formation, presenting a perfect opportunity for a barrage of spells to be used against them. Waves of lightning, fire, and cold spells washed over that battlefield and sent their bones scattering all over the street. Seeing most of the skeletons vanquished the defenders broke into a resounding cheer, until realization set in that there was more to come. Looking past the fallen skeletons, we could see a torrent of undead now flooding through the gate.

The guttural sounds of ghouls began to fill the air and along with these ghouls walked another couple legions of skeletons. However, it was behind them that a truly frightening undead began to move, hulking figures of towering bone that stood as high as many of Elvala's buildings. A final line of skeletons also appeared too, but unlike the others they appeared to be armed with staves and bows. Quickly the undead began to organize themselves before moving lockstep with each other in our direction. Our mages attempted to ready another set of spells but quickly found this quite difficult as arrows and spells from the undead rained down on them. Realizing we would have to engage the undead fully we raised our shields and proceeded to step forward.

As the front lines drew closer, we would be caught off guard when the ghouls made giant leaps over our entire formation. We soon found ourselves boxed in as ghouls clawed us in the back while the remaining undead forces collided into us from the front. With little room to maneuver, shaloren archers and mages behind us were cut down, while soldiers in front could do little more than keep their shields in front of them to block attacks. Panicking, those who could teleport broke from the line, leaving the rest of us to fend off the encroaching undead horde. The situation was looking quite bleak as we found ourselves trapped by the undead and everything was thrown into complete disarray.]], [[[i]Looking past the gruesome nature of the undead, I can somewhat appreciate the brilliance of the tactics and strategy that they employed.

Seeing most of the skeletons vanquished the defenders broke into a resounding cheer, until realization set in that there was more to come. Looking past the fallen skeletons, we could see a torrent of undead now flooding through the gate.

The guttural sounds of ghouls began to fill the air and along with these ghouls walked another couple legions of skeletons. However, it was behind them that a truly frightening undead began to move, hulking figures of towering bone that stood as high as many of Elvala's buildings. A final line of skeletons also appeared too, but unlike the others they appeared to be armed with staves and bows. Quickly the undead began to organize themselves before moving lockstep with each other in our direction. Our mages attempted to ready another set of spells but quickly found this quite difficult as arrows and spells from the undead rained down on them. Realizing we would have to engage the undead fully we raised our shields and proceeded to step forward.

As the front lines drew closer, we would be caught off guard when the ghouls made giant leaps over our entire formation. We soon found ourselves boxed in as ghouls clawed us in the back while the remaining undead forces collided into us from the front. With little room to maneuver, shaloren archers and mages behind us were cut down, while soldiers in front could do little more than keep their shields in front of them to block attacks. Panicking, those who could teleport broke from the line, leaving the rest of us to fend off the encroaching undead horde. The situation was looking quite bleak as we found ourselves trapped by the undead and everything was thrown into complete disarray.]], "_t")

We had been lucky in the defense of Elvala with the aid from the ogres and eventually rallying leadership of Aranion.  Without them all hope of victory would have surely been lost.[/i]

The hatred within me began to build as enemies attacked from in front and behind. However, I had my own problems to deal with as one of the bone giants, as I would call them, stepped up to clobber me. Managing to somehow avoid the first attack I focused the chaotic energies within me and unleashed a powerful strike that destroyed a good portion of its lower body. This seemed to be to no avail though as the bone giant reorganizeed and shifted the bones of its body around to form a protective barrier before seemingly beginning to rebuild itself. The bone giant then proceeded to unleash another strike against me that left me stunned and temporarily unable to react. Put on my back foot, matters only got worse when a ghoul approached me from behind and bit deeply into my shoulder.

The situation was looking quite hopeless but from behind I heard a voice yell and out of the corner of my eye I saw a ghoul careen passed me. A flash of frost shot forth and blasted a hole through the ghoul as well as blowing off one of the arms of the bone giant in front of me. Glancing to the side I noticed a young ogre step up and I could hear the giant footsteps of stampeding ogres that were hurrying towards the fray. I didn't have much time to observe what was happening around me however as the bone giant turned its attention to me and the ogre. Attacking the first ogre, the much bigger bone giant brought down an attack with its other arm, knocking the ogre away like a rag doll.

Leaving itself open to my side I lunged to attack the bone giant once again, but this had little effect as I had little strength to cause any damage and the barrier of bones surrounding the bone giant's body absorbed the entirety of the blow. Responding to my efforts I was subsequently battered with another powerful attack and sent reeling away. Yet again though the ogre would come to my aid, charging into the bulk of the bone giant, and knocking it backwards away from me before it could make a follow up attack. Seeing me in my exhausted state, the ogre shouted over his shoulder for me to run, before activating a shielding run and bracing himself for the retaliation that would come. Battered and bruised I began to move away to recover.

After getting some distance away from the skirmish, I turned to survey the battlefield in its entirety. The undead line had been broken significantly by the charging ogres who had come to aid us, but a good deal of our defensive line was injured or dead. Many of those shaloren who had teleported away had now returned to fight, engaging in small groups on all sides of the undead army, and keeping the undead off balance. However, the line of skeleton archers and mages of the undead force remained largely intact, and were now picking off individual defenders in their unguarded flanks. The scene was one of chaos, and I could not tell if we were winning or losing, but nonetheless I could hear the screams of my fellow defenders dying all around me.

"It seems that this has turned into quite the battle,” a voice came out from behind me. All of a sudden as those words were being stated I could feel myself being enveloped in a bright glow, as my bruises disappeared and wounds began to heal. Turning to face the voice I came face to face with an armored shalore holding a glowing hand outstretched in my direction. I recognized the armor worn and weapon held as being the same set from the Grand Council Chambers. Putting his hand down the shalore continued, "I'm no doctor but this should be enough to keep you on your feet until the battle’s end. Now then, let's see..." He paused for a moment as he looked at the battlefield and then took a deep breath.

Then, in a rather surprisingly loud voice for a shalore he yelled, "DEFENDERS! FOCUS YOUR EFFORTS ON CRUSHING THE SKELETON ARCHERS AND MAGES, LEAVE THOSE HULKING BONE MONSTROSITIES AND ARMORED SKELETONS TO ME!" Before I even had a chance to understand what had been said, the shalore teleported himself in front of the ogre that had come to my aid and in an instant struck the side of the bone giant. All at once a violent display of colors exploded all around the bone giant that shattered the monstrosity into a thousand pieces all over the street. Not missing a beat, the shalore swiftly dove onto the next bone giant nearby and brought it down with little effort as well.

Seeing this display I immediately began to regain my will to fight, and following the order given I charged forward. However, before I could reach the undead ranged supporters a couple armored skeletons step forward with shields raised to meet me. Looking to break through them I stepped forward with a heavy strike only to have my attack deflected and my footing thrown off balance. Seeing an opportunity, one of the skeletons dropped its shield down and prepared to launch a counterattack against me. Before its attack could connect though, a heavy swipe flew over my head, sending its skull sailing away. From behind me another one of the ogres stepped forward and together we converged on the other skeleton.

After sending bones flying, I nodded to the ogre, and we continued on towards the waiting archers and mages. Along with the other ogres and shaloren we dove deep within the enemy ranks, hewing our weapons through their undefended line. Perhaps realizing that they had no hope of winning, the skeletons turned around and began to move away, seemingly entering into a retreat. Getting ready to pursue them, we were stopped by the remaining ghouls who jumped into our way, and the remaining bone giants that had not yet been dispatched. While the undead had been weakened enough to no longer be a threat, they would buy enough time for the skeleton archers and mages to escape out the gate and into the Shroud.]], [[[i]As an experienced commander would tell me long after the battle with the undead "the winner of a battle is not necessarily dictated by the amount of enemies slain but rather by which side breaks first."

t([[[i]I was oddly able to get back on my feet quite easily after receiving the initial healing spell cast on me, perhaps even quicker than what was normally possibly. This would hold true to the additional healing I would receive moments after. There is something about the chaotic energies within me that interacts with my body and allows it to mend quicker with the more hate I feel. This isn't something I can easily take advantage of however and should the hatred within me dissipate before I receive any medical attention it will result in a long and arduous recovery time.[/i]

It was at that point in the battle that I knew we had won. The bone giants that remained still proved to be quite a threat, but with enough overwhelming force we eventually got through their defenses and defeated them. As the last of the undead were felled the defenders began to break into another victory cheer. I was about to join them but I noticed the bright glow of another healing spell enveloping me once more. Turning around I noticed that the spell was being cast by one of the healers this time. "Get Fay healed as quickly as possibly doctor, I want her back in peak form as fast as possible." Hearing my name I wondered just who this shalore was as few in Elvala knew my name.

As the shalore took off his helmet I immediately would come to recognize Aranion Gawaeil's face. Speaking quickly to me he stated, "We will be exiting through the Shroud to see if we can catch whoever was responsible for this attack. Judging how the undead were acting, it is likely that whoever sent these attacks must be nearby." Registering his words I silently nodded to him, after which he proceeded to put back on his helmet and look out towards the direction of the Shroud. When the healer's healing spell was finished, Aranion directed the healer to get the wounded to the healing grounds, before holding out his hand in my direction. Readying myself I took a deep breath and took his hand.

In an instant Aranion cast a spell to teleport us to the other side of the Shroud. Taking a moment to get my bearings, it didn't take long for us to notice the retreating undead group, or the lone cloaked figure moving among them. I didn't have much time to glimpse at my surroundings before Aranion motioned me to follow. Keeping a good distance we shadowed the undead as we followed them to the northwest. For a couple of days we traveled just west of the Nargol borders, passing many destroyed settlements which showed signs of being recently attacked. I had guessed that the Nargols had attempted to reclaim these settlements, only for them to be attacked and their inhabitants turned into undead thralls, the same of which likely attacked Elvala.

After a time we slowly made our way into another settlement after the undead force, only to notice them stop therein. Nearing the edge of one of the buildings to catch a glimpse of what they were doing we spied the cloaked figure near a well. Out from one of the buildings a couple of skeletons emerged carrying some food on a plate. Whispering in a hushed voice Aranion quietly stated, "It appears, unlike the undead following him, our friend here is alive." As if on cue to Aranion's statement, a low raspy voice spoke from the cloaked figure saying, "Yes very much so alive." Dead silence permeated the air for a long moment after that, apart from the sound of food being eaten by the figure.

The entire time this was happening, the undead stood motionless. Sensing that the figured wished to talk, Aranion stepped out in full view, hand on his weapon but not yet drawn. Seeing Aranion come into view the figure stated, "Ahhhh, you were the one who was capable of crushing my creations in one blow, I must say I wasn't expecting someone to be capable of that, well done. Although your abilities in stealth are perhaps not as notable." At that moment Aranion drew his sword and stood at the ready with it stating, "I'd very much like to crush the creator as well." To this a raspy laugh escaped from the cloaked figure before a hand appeared and motioned towards Aranion to try.

Without hesitation Aranion immediately began charging forwards. Reacting to the sudden movement, the undead quickly moved to form a defensive line and block Aranion's approach. Consisting mostly of mages and archers at this point, they laid down a volley of projectiles and magic in Aranion's direction. In a mere instant Aranion teleported himself next to the cloaked figure, avoiding it all entirely. Reacting to this, the cloaked figure produced a sphere of protective magical energy to meet Aranion's attack. Tightly gripping his sword with both hands, Aranion raised it above his head and brought it down in a powerful swing. After that I am not sure as to what happened as a bright flash shot forward as the two powerful combatants clashed.

I'm not entirely sure of what had happened, but what I do know is that there was an explosion of energy that erupted between Aranion and the necromancer, creating a shock wave that ripped through the remnants of the settlement. Finding myself within one of the buildings I stumbled to my feet and attempted to reorient myself. When I was able to, I made my way out to the hole in the wall I had been thrown through to survey what had happened outside. Looking around all I could see was a scene of destruction as torn ground, ruined buildings, and charred air remained. Stepping out from the building my foot crushed one of many shattered bones that now lay strewn about the battlefield. This would unfortunately be noticed by several skeletons that had survived the blast.

When they raised their weapons in my general direction I knew I needed to act quickly. I approached a couple of the closer ones and deftly broke them into pieces with a couple well placed strikes. I was about to charge towards the rest but then I noticed a couple of the skeletons raising staves in my direction. Rapidly I dove behind the rubble of a nearby building and hid from the barrage of magic that lit up the space I had just been in. Getting to my feet and holding my weapon tightly I could hear them advancing towards my position. I readied myself and waited for the skeletons to come closer and watched for the moment when they would appear around the corner.]], [[[i]I was oddly able to get back on my feet quite easily after receiving the initial healing spell cast on me, perhaps even quicker than what was normally possibly.

Unfortunately not as mindless as I thought they would be, the skeletons were smart enough to keep their distance as they rounded the corner. Cursing, I began to run as fast as I could in an attempt to close the gap as fast as possible as the skeletons sent forth a volley of spells. My anger exploding at this point I felt a chaotic rush of energy fill me and in the next moment I was cleaving my weapon through the body of one of the mages from the side. Not missing a beat at my movement, the other skeleton promptly turned to face the new direction and unleashed a searing ray of arcane energies that clipped through my shoulder. I was about to converge on the other skeleton, but an arrow would then pierce through my foot and pin me to the ground.

Realizing I needed to end this quickly, I raised my arm and immediately discharged my heat beam rune into the other mage, before rushing after the archer that had loosed the arrow. Seeing my advance it released another arrow in my direction which I sidestepped out of the way of with ease. In the next moment I was on top of the archer, senselessly battering it into submission with a relentlessly torrent of blows. When the archer was dealt with I turned once more to look in the direction of the skeleton mage. Merely walking over to it I simply cast my arm out and knocked its skull from its skeletal frame before it had a chance to cast another spell.

I panted heavily for the next few moments as the hatred within me slowly began to subside once again. As I slowly caught my breath then heard the distinct sound of applause and looking for the source of I spied the cloaked figure of the necromancer nearby. As the clapping finished, the necromancer began to speak, "Well done, well done." Checking my surroundings I could not see Aranion around in our vicinity, making me wonder what had happened to him. Deciding to inquire as to Aranion whereabouts I asked, "Where's Aranion." To this I got the response "Oh? As in Aranion Gawaeil? Well, the general is occupied, at least for the moment. Likely he'll be back soon but for now I think I'll entertain myself with you."

A cold feeling immediately took hold of me as the necromancer finished its sentence and abruptly began to wheeze and chuckle. As I approached with my weapon drawn and ready to swing my weapon the necromancer reached within its cloak and teleported away to a pile of shattered bones. I froze in place as a dark sensation as the necromancer pulled something out, something that I knew held great power, great and terrible. Attempting to discern the object, I was able to make out a short thin staff, but not one that looked to be made of any material I had seen a staff made of before. Perhaps sensing my awareness of the staff the necromancer spoke again, "Oh? You don't seem to be a mage yet you can feel this dark power can't you?"

"Bones are so interesting you know, they can tell you a lot about a person. You can learn their owner's identity, where and when they lived, how old they were when they died, the injuries and hardships they had suffered in their lives, and so forth. Quite fascinating really, of course studying them is quite frowned upon, quite bothersome really." The necromancer began to cough and wheeze a few time before continuing. "Some of the most peculiar bones I've come across can be found within my staff, and when I find some peculiar bones I would like to add to my staff..." The sentence trailed off and the necromancer started to chuckle. A chill then went down my spine as I could feel the dark intentions of the necromancer focusing on me.

I watched the necromancer make quick motion of the staff towards the bone pile causing all the bones within the pile to begin to organize themselves into a mass of towering bones. Limbs of all manner of terror and death began to form as a new bone giant was created. The necromancer let loose a raspy joyous cackle before indicating to the bone giant with a motion of the staff that I was an enemy to be clobbered. Responding to the command the bone giant started moving in my direction. Looking to inflict the first blow I unleashed as powerful an attack as I could against the abomination, I charged forward and attacked one of its legs, hoping to knock it off balance and gain a quick advantage over it.

Much like before in Elvala however, this bone giant too would shift its bones around to reinforce the damage I inflicted on it, managing to negate the efforts of my attack. In the next moment I could do nothing as it suddenly shot forth one of its limbs and caught me in the arm. The spikes and razor sharp joints tore through the armor covering my shoulder causing great pain. In an attempt to return a blow I pushed forward again, but due to the pain from my received injury I was prevented from mustering all the physical force that I could. Hatred began to boil within me as I was knocked around by heavy blows before finally I unleashed my chaotic energies into the bone giant in an attempt to stunt its movements.

The bone giant quickly began to falter and become clumsy, my chaotic energies interfering with its ability to move. Trying to attack me while under the pressure of my hatred its attacks became slow and readable and I was able to dodge them. Now on the offensive I slashed heavily against the creature all over its body in an attempt to overwhelm it. Once again a barrier of bones formed to defend it, but not the least bit discouraged I relentlessly continued my attack, eventually breaking through. Unable to withstand my continual ferocity its bones flew in all directions as I tore through it from front to back. Now standing facing the necromancer, I could hear the bone giant behind me collapse back into a pile of bones once more.]], [[[i]First rule of combat, always have a plan of escape ready in case you get into trouble.

I froze in place as a dark sensation as the necromancer pulled something out, something that I knew held great power, great and terrible. Attempting to discern the object, I was able to make out a short thin staff, but not one that looked to be made of any material I had seen a staff made of before. Perhaps sensing my awareness of the staff the necromancer spoke again, "Oh? You don't seem to be a mage yet you can feel this dark power can't you?"

"Bones are so interesting you know, they can tell you a lot about a person. You can learn their owner's identity, where and when they lived, how old they were when they died, the injuries and hardships they had suffered in their lives, and so forth. Quite fascinating really, of course studying them is quite frowned upon, quite bothersome really." The necromancer began to cough and wheeze a few time before continuing. "Some of the most peculiar bones I've come across can be found within my staff, and when I find some peculiar bones I would like to add to my staff..." The sentence trailed off and the necromancer started to chuckle. A chill then went down my spine as I could feel the dark intentions of the necromancer focusing on me.

I watched the necromancer make quick motion of the staff towards the bone pile causing all the bones within the pile to begin to organize themselves into a mass of towering bones. Limbs of all manner of terror and death began to form as a new bone giant was created. The necromancer let loose a raspy joyous cackle before indicating to the bone giant with a motion of the staff that I was an enemy to be clobbered. Responding to the command the bone giant started moving in my direction. Looking to inflict the first blow I unleashed as powerful an attack as I could against the abomination, I charged forward and attacked one of its legs, hoping to knock it off balance and gain a quick advantage over it.

Much like before in Elvala however, this bone giant too would shift its bones around to reinforce the damage I inflicted on it, managing to negate the efforts of my attack. In the next moment I could do nothing as it suddenly shot forth one of its limbs and caught me in the arm. The spikes and razor sharp joints tore through the armor covering my shoulder causing great pain. In an attempt to return a blow I pushed forward again, but due to the pain from my received injury I was prevented from mustering all the physical force that I could. Hatred began to boil within me as I was knocked around by heavy blows before finally I unleashed my chaotic energies into the bone giant in an attempt to stunt its movements.

The bone giant quickly began to falter and become clumsy, my chaotic energies interfering with its ability to move. Trying to attack me while under the pressure of my hatred its attacks became slow and readable and I was able to dodge them. Now on the offensive I slashed heavily against the creature all over its body in an attempt to overwhelm it. Once again a barrier of bones formed to defend it, but not the least bit discouraged I relentlessly continued my attack, eventually breaking through. Unable to withstand my continual ferocity its bones flew in all directions as I tore through it from front to back. Now standing facing the necromancer, I could hear the bone giant behind me collapse back into a pile of bones once more.]], "_t")

t([[[i]There is truly no other way to describe the necromancer that I met but completely evil. One might consider the magic hating fanatics I had written about in my earlier books as evil, but even from them I could sense that they were attempting to bring about a better world, despite how twisted their actions might have been. This fiend of undeath though, I could sense no goodwill from, and the actions undertaken seemed to be only for the purpose of personal amusement. Judging from emotions that I could feel from the magic as well, I don't think that necromancy could ever be used by anyone other than those of an evil nature.[/i]

As I felled the bone giant I could hear the necromancer clapping once more. "Very good, well done, quite the display. Your bones will truly be worth adding to my staff,” the necromancer stated in sinister tone. Turning my head towards necromancer I stated boldly, "It will take more than your mere bone giant to kill me." Seemingly caught in thought to my statement the necromancer replied, "Hmmm, bone giant, quite the name. Yes, I think that will do nicely as a name. Of course, you seem to be misunderstanding something. The bone giant, as you call it, is not quite dead yet." Registering the words, I didn't have much time to react before I could feel a hard blow swat me from the side.

Snapping my eyes to what had hit me, I immediately realized that the bone giant was indeed not defeated as it stepped forward to stand in between me and the necromancer. What's more, it had seemed that it had reassembled itself into a new fiendish form that was ready to do battle. As the bone giant approached to attack me I could hear the voice of the necromancer in the background as are battle began to start again. "These Bone Giants as you call them are quite something aren't they. I got inspiration for them from the Nargols when they fought against the Conclave in the Allure Wars. You see, few know this but the Nargols actually used necromancy to ultimately win their fight against the Conclave."

I could hear the necromancer wheeze and cackle in the background for a moment, but I was more concerned with the bone giant attacking me. Somewhat exhausted from beating it down the first time I lacked the strength to overcome its defenses a second time and bring it down again. I slowly proceeded to back away in order to buy some time and examine my options in regards to what I might be able to do to defeat it. The swirling barrier of bones were already circling its body, and I knew that I wouldn't be able to do any lasting damage against it as a result. Sooner or later I would have to commit to fighting it fully, and I knew that I would want to make that commitment on my own terms.

Distressingly however, finding an opportunity was made more difficult as the necromancer continued to prattle on. "These bone giants as you call them, they can be formed in a variety of ways to kill and as you can see they are quite durable. I'm actually quite thankful that you managed to rip through it as you did just now, I can already see ways in which I can improve my next one." Concluding the sentence the necromancer began to laugh and wheeze once more. It was quite infuriating, and I'm not even sure why I remember the necromancer's words so vividly. However, I would not be bested by the bone giant and I decided that I would try to make a final stand and bring it down again.

I rushed into the bone giant, taking a quick swipe that knocked a few bones away. Noticing that the bone barrier didn't absorb the blow I quickly realized that it had since dissipated. Sensing that I only had a brief moment before it would come back, I fully committed to unleashing as much power as I could within the next strike. Hitting with all the strength I could muster I quickly knocked away a good chunk of the bone giant’s mid section, causing it to stumble a bit. Once again like before it attempted to shift its bones around in order to maintain itself, but my attacks were chipping bones away bit by bit. However, the bone giant would not allow itself to be defeated so easily.

With a quick motion the bone giant shot forth one of its limbs against me, once again ripping against my flesh with painful spikes. Not discouraged by this in the slightest however, I let loose my heat beam rune and ignited its bones, and more importantly I relieved the pain from the blow. As I resumed my attacks I could hear the raspy voice in the background seemingly comment, "Hmm, runes... ohhh! I know, I'll graft some runes onto the next one! What interesting ideas you are giving me." Still focused on my fight, I continued to strike it again and again until finally the bone giant fell apart. Not sure if it would get up again I continued to hack at it until I had completely disassembled it.

Forgetting about the necromancer though, I immediately felt my body go numb, and quickly noticed ice forming all around my body. Immobilized, I darted my eyes around before spying the necromancer with an outstretched hand. Slowly the necromancer approached me, coming around to my left arm where my heat beam rune was inscribed. Putting its hand under what I assumed to be its chin, the necromancer noted, "Not once but twice you have defeated my bone giant. I suspected you might be able to bring it down once, but bringing it down again right after was quite unexpected. Now, I really have to wonder who you are? You appear to be a thalore to me, but what were you doing in Elvala? Hmmm."

Continuing around me to stand in front before circling around to my right, necromancer continued to make "hmm, hmm" sounds. Proceeding to stop the necromancer began to muse aloud once more, "Quite surprising seeing you use runes. Are you a criminal exiled from the forests perhaps? Wait, what's this second rune you have inscribed?" While I couldn't see the necromancer I could feel the intent staring at the Rune of Return that had been inscribed on the back of my neck. From behind a remark rang out, "Ahh, interesting. A shaloren design but judging from the markings it appears an ogre's handiwork was involved in inscribing this rune if I am not mistaken. Quite intriguing."

The necromancer continued to talk aloud for several moments as he circled around me again and again, which was fine by me. I could feel the arcane energy replenishing within my heat beam rune, and when I had the chance I would activate it and release myself from my icy imprisonment. Perhaps aware of my intent though the necromancer quickly glanced at my eyes before stating, "You are quite an oddity aren't you? However, you aren't much the conversationalist so there is little reason for me to keep you alive. I can easily study your corpse instead of leaving you alive you see." I could sense the magic beginning to accumulate in one of the necromancer's hands as he concluded by saying, "Farewell thalore." ]], [[[i]There is truly no other way to describe the necromancer that I met but completely evil.

Even now as I write this, Aranion frets over his lost sword as if he had lost a loved one. While I can understand how one can get accustomed to a weapon, surely he can find another to use instead?[/i]

Sensing that I needed to act now, I activated the heat beam rune, melting the ice around and me and sending a surging blast of fire towards the necromancer. As the necromancer stumbled back in flames as I took the moment to heave my weapon forward with all the force I could muster, only to pierce through nothing as the necromancer disappeared. Before I had a chance to see where the necromancer had teleported too, a burst of hot flames enveloped me from behind. Turning around I could see the necromancer, singed yet no longer on fire. I had been read completely and now I danced around in searing pain as every inch of my body burned. The necromancer cackled as I noticed the heat beam rune inscribed on the bottom of his outstretched arm.

Annoyed at how easily I had been handled, I grit my teeth and charged forward at the necromancer, only to be stopped by several undead blocking my way. Cackling some more, I felt a sharp pain cut through me as the necromancer released a dark beam of energy that shot through the skeletons and me. As I cringed in pain and had little time to react before the necromancer's minions began to attack me from all sides. Infuriated, I began to strike at everything surrounding me, tearing a path through the undead up to the necromancer. Coming face to face with the fiend I was about to deliver a great blow, but with a simple wave at me I felt a heavy force slam into my chest.

Darkness seemed to pierce my mind and try as I might I could not resist it. I was sent careening backwards where I slammed into a wall. My vision began to blur as I lay on the ground. Despite this however I could still hear the necromancer cackle before the yammering began again. "How pathetic, really you are. Fighting is more than just hitting things with overwhelming force! You are truly powerful thalore, but power in and of itself is meaningless. Your moves are too telegraphed, your attacks are easily countered, and you don't seem to have the slightest idea of how to strategize in combat. Oh well. Perhaps after I kill you I'll just raise your corpse as it is and show you how to properly engage yourself in a fight."

Despite my inability to remember things said to me, I remember those words quite well as they rang through my head. Poetically I could say that they pierced me more than any wound inflicted on me that day, but that would fail to describe just how many spellblasts and cursed spells would be sent into my body. For every action I would make the necromancer would be two steps ahead and for every mistake I would make I would pay dearly. As the battle went on I could feel my body beginning to grow colder and I knew that despite how tough I was I could not continue to sustain my fighting efforts for much longer. My desperation was perhaps just as noticeable as anything else by the necromancer.

Then at last my body could stand no more and I collapsed to the ground unable to move. Waves of cold and dark energy circulated within my body and I realized just how close to the limits of my own mortality I was. I remember as my thoughts turned over to past events of my life in that moment, to a time before the Spellblaze when I lived in the forests with my fellow thaloren, a simpler and more peaceful time to be sure. I didn't want to die, nor suffer whatever mad plans this necromancer would have for me either. Yet I could do nothing more now as the necromancer slowly approached to stand over me and say, "Such a fruitless effort thalore. Perhaps with time you would have become a notable hero of legend. But now you die."

In the next moment I could not describe to you the amount of pain that ripped through my body as the necromancer unleashed a deathly magic that tortured every fibre of my being. As I was engulfed in agony my mind slowly began to black out and I slowly edged closer and closer to death. I might have been killed had Aranion not managed to return just in time to interrupt the necromancer and cancel the spell cast on me. I don't know the specifics of what happened next after that, only that Aranion was somehow able to extract me and himself from the grasp of the necromancer and escape. Somehow I endured long enough after that for Aranion to cast a basic healing spell on me, enough to keep me alive until we returned to Elvala.

I briefly remember when I was initially recovering that I opened my eyes while laying in one of the medical beds back in Elvala. In a chair near me I saw my husband sleeping, waiting for me. I tried to call out but instead I let out a scream. My husband would call for a healer as my body was wracked in pain from the many injuries I had endured for so long. I would sleep for a long time after that, for how long I do not know, but the next time I woke up I would be in my own room within my house. Looking around once again I could see that it was nighttime, and my husband again sat sleeping in a chair, still waiting for me. For how long he waited I do not know.

Once more I called out saying his name "Awain". As he roused from his sleep and looked at me an endless amount of tears would begin streaming down his face. In a cracked voice I heard him say, "You're awake, you're still alive." He hurried over to me, putting his hands under me to embrace me tightly, and began sobbing uncontrollably. For the moment I allowed him to cry, feeling that I should hold back on inquiring as to how I had made it back to Elvala. I didn't know how long I had been unconscious but I had the feeling that he had waited the entire time for me, waiting for the moment I would come back to him.

t([[Eventually when I got the story from my husband, I found out what had happened after the battle in detail. The necromancer had apparently fled or perhaps had allowed for Aranion to retreat with me back to Elvala. I was very close to death, but the healers worked tirelessly to stabilize my condition, although having difficulties doing so due to my Spellblaze Affliction and terrible injuries that had been wrought on my body by the necromancer's spells. For many days I remained within the medical facilities, as the healers worked to save my life, before eventually being relocated to my own home under the care of my husband.

At this point a sombre expression took hold of my husbands face, his eyes looking in the direction of my body. Lifting the covers up I soon understood why, seeing the blacken scars engraved into my body, a result of my recent battle. Meekly he told me that while the healers were sure I would live, the wounds inflicted on my body would leave deformed scars that would never heal. For a moment I sat still, as I contemplated what to say. Then smiling any without hesitation I looked up, pulling off the covers and made to stand. Pain surged through me as I did so but I stood in front of my husband nonetheless.

Awain's eyes darted around and his mouth stammered, until I looked him in his eyes and made my way over to kiss him. Raising my head I stated to him in a quiet tone, "I do not care how I look as long as you Awain still love me. That alone is enough for me to continue on." At this his body relaxed as I slowly descended to kiss him once more, being embraced within his arms. As I drew closer to him he quietly gave the response, "Yes Fay, I still do,” before he finally began to kiss me back. I remember that night as being one of my most cherished moments in my life. Despite my many travels and life prior I would change nothing for it.

Yet despite the incident that had brought me so close to dying, I knew in my heart that I yearned to leave Elvala once more for adventure. One may think it odd, but at the moment I left with Aranion from the exterior of the Shroud I was reminded of my initial travels that had brought me to Elvala in the first place. Though it has taken a couple decades for me to recover, I now prepare to exit through the Shroud once more to explore the world. Awain deeply disagrees with my decision to leave, but out of his love for me he won't stop me from going. I also know that should I ever truly find myself in danger I can use the Rune of Return still inscribed on me to return from danger.

From what I've learned from the Shaloren scouts there is now much happening outside Elvala's walls to serve as destinations to visit. Lawless bands of men now roam the nearby lands, some driven to banditry by desperation, others seeing an opportunity to take from others as a result of Nargols being unable to exact control over their lands as they once did. Despite our seclusion, it is a problem that affects us here in Elvala as well, as what little interaction we have with the outside world is made even more difficult. It is believed that a major hideout and staging area for attacks can be found in the Old Forest just to the north of here.

Rumours of those magic hating zealots are also abound as are the heinous atrocities that they commit. Their reach is vast and it is believed that they are influencing the politics of many Human Kingdoms and the Eldoral Halflings. No longer content to act in the shadows, trained bands of their anti-magic warriors scour the lands for any who cast magic or are in possession of items powered by the arcane. Curiously there is speculation about some ogres fighting among their ranks, though how that is possible I don't know. Still, I should be careful should I run into one of their traveling groups as I would have a difficult fight on my hands to be sure.

Outside of the various movements of such distasteful groups, some of the shaloren researching the effects caused by the Spellblaze believe that the most prevalent mark of destruction can likely be found along the Blackened Shoreline to the east of Elvala. This was the initial path that the destructive energies of the Spellblaze took and it is reasoned that a better understanding can be obtained by visiting the area. However, the shaloren know that venturing out past the Shroud would be dangerous, not to mention how hazardous those lands are. Despite the dangers, though, it is important to know just what sort of lasting damage the Spellblaze has left on our world.

[i]I won't be discouraged from leaving Elvala because of the battle I lost with the necromancer, though that doesn't mean I will rashly throw my life away either. There are people who need help and villainous schemes to be thwarted and if I can help with this task then I shall. I will be cautious in whatever I pursue in the outside world and you can be sure, Awain, that I will soon be writing another book of my escapades. Wait for me my dear husband for when I come home you know that the first thing I will do is return to your arms. But for now I set off from this land I call home to offer aid where I can.[/i] ]], [[Eventually when I got the story from my husband, I found out what had happened after the battle in detail. The necromancer had apparently fled or perhaps had allowed for Aranion to retreat with me back to Elvala. I was very close to death, but the healers worked tirelessly to stabilize my condition, although having difficulties doing so due to my Spellblaze Affliction and terrible injuries that had been wrought on my body by the necromancer's spells. For many days I remained within the medical facilities, as the healers worked to save my life, before eventually being relocated to my own home under the care of my husband.

At this point a sombre expression took hold of my husbands face, his eyes looking in the direction of my body. Lifting the covers up I soon understood why, seeing the blacken scars engraved into my body, a result of my recent battle. Meekly he told me that while the healers were sure I would live, the wounds inflicted on my body would leave deformed scars that would never heal. For a moment I sat still, as I contemplated what to say. Then smiling any without hesitation I looked up, pulling off the covers and made to stand. Pain surged through me as I did so but I stood in front of my husband nonetheless.

Awain's eyes darted around and his mouth stammered, until I looked him in his eyes and made my way over to kiss him. Raising my head I stated to him in a quiet tone, "I do not care how I look as long as you Awain still love me. That alone is enough for me to continue on." At this his body relaxed as I slowly descended to kiss him once more, being embraced within his arms. As I drew closer to him he quietly gave the response, "Yes Fay, I still do,” before he finally began to kiss me back. I remember that night as being one of my most cherished moments in my life. Despite my many travels and life prior I would change nothing for it.

Yet despite the incident that had brought me so close to dying, I knew in my heart that I yearned to leave Elvala once more for adventure. One may think it odd, but at the moment I left with Aranion from the exterior of the Shroud I was reminded of my initial travels that had brought me to Elvala in the first place. Though it has taken a couple decades for me to recover, I now prepare to exit through the Shroud once more to explore the world. Awain deeply disagrees with my decision to leave, but out of his love for me he won't stop me from going. I also know that should I ever truly find myself in danger I can use the Rune of Return still inscribed on me to return from danger.

From what I've learned from the Shaloren scouts there is now much happening outside Elvala's walls to serve as destinations to visit. Lawless bands of men now roam the nearby lands, some driven to banditry by desperation, others seeing an opportunity to take from others as a result of Nargols being unable to exact control over their lands as they once did. Despite our seclusion, it is a problem that affects us here in Elvala as well, as what little interaction we have with the outside world is made even more difficult. It is believed that a major hideout and staging area for attacks can be found in the Old Forest just to the north of here.

Rumours of those magic hating zealots are also abound as are the heinous atrocities that they commit. Their reach is vast and it is believed that they are influencing the politics of many Human Kingdoms and the Eldoral Halflings. No longer content to act in the shadows, trained bands of their anti-magic warriors scour the lands for any who cast magic or are in possession of items powered by the arcane. Curiously there is speculation about some ogres fighting among their ranks, though how that is possible I don't know. Still, I should be careful should I run into one of their traveling groups as I would have a difficult fight on my hands to be sure.

Outside of the various movements of such distasteful groups, some of the shaloren researching the effects caused by the Spellblaze believe that the most prevalent mark of destruction can likely be found along the Blackened Shoreline to the east of Elvala. This was the initial path that the destructive energies of the Spellblaze took and it is reasoned that a better understanding can be obtained by visiting the area. However, the shaloren know that venturing out past the Shroud would be dangerous, not to mention how hazardous those lands are. Despite the dangers, though, it is important to know just what sort of lasting damage the Spellblaze has left on our world.

[i]I won't be discouraged from leaving Elvala because of the battle I lost with the necromancer, though that doesn't mean I will rashly throw my life away either. There are people who need help and villainous schemes to be thwarted and if I can help with this task then I shall. I will be cautious in whatever I pursue in the outside world and you can be sure, Awain, that I will soon be writing another book of my escapades. Wait for me my dear husband for when I come home you know that the first thing I will do is return to your arms. But for now I set off from this land I call home to offer aid where I can.[/i] ]], "_t")

t([[The story of Kroshkkur is not a peaceful one. Those of us who gathered here know that we have no place anywhere else. The surface would never accept us, for our forms are terrible for them to behold. Even in the depths of Eyal, we have had to fight for our place in the world. These endless tunnels and the creatures within them have sought to destroy us. They hunger for our very souls.

When Kroshkkur was first discovered, it was infested with horrors. We cut them down and attempted to restore the strange arcane machines we found here. Alas, we found it to be damaged and could only partially restore it. But, even that small amount of power it held was enough to give us safety. Many followed us after that, outcasts who were looking for a haven in a hostile underground. Intelligent beings who do not belong anywhere else, seekers of forbidden knowledge and those who have seen too much for mortal eyes to bear are just a few who have made their homes here.

Since then, we have studied. We have divined this world's secrets and delved into the dark places which surface dwellers dare not look, out of fear of what might be looking back. We have no such fear, for we are the things looking back. In these places, we have found out many truths and discovered magic which will change the course of Eyal's history.

We will bide our time down here in the dark and turn this place into a beacon of knowledge. If this world will not give us a place in it, then we shall simply take one for ourselves. We shall make ourselves known to the surface when the time is right, and show them that we aren't just scattered, mindless beings for them to sweep aside.]], [[The story of Kroshkkur is not a peaceful one.

t([[Gods are beings which have been frequently mentioned throughout Eyal's history. They are a foreign concept to most readers, since most Eyalites of the current age have not encountered them. The word god gives you the impression of some almighty and obscenely powerful being, which these beings most certainly are. But, there has been little scholarly work dedicated to defining what exactly a god is. Multiple cultures across Eyal's history all have varying descriptions of the gods, despite the same names frequently appearing among them. 

As a scholar of Kroshkkur, I spent much time wandering the surface of Eyal and learning from the surface races regarding the gods, including many famous places of learning such as Anglowen. It was a hard sell, but I even managed to [i]convince[/i] an imp to retrieve certain documentation on Urk'Rok as well. This series of documents has been written to catalogue information regarding the gods and to develop as accurate a picture of them as myth and history will allow and this preface is to give a general impression of what exactly a god is supposed to be.

There have been many powerful beings who have walked across the surface of Eyal. Being a god isn't simply a question of power, however, despite the enormous strength of these beings. What separates gods from other beings is their ability to reverse entropy. For future reference, we shall refer to this power as antropy. This power also allows them to reshape reality to their own whims and desires. Some gods made their own races, others merely altered beings living on Eyal, playing with their evolution and changing them in unfathomable ways. While some might attribute this behaviour to some greater purpose, there is more than enough evidence to suggest that the gods are fallible and motivated by things just as petty as we mere mortals. In my scholarly opinion, we were simply created for their amusement.

While this might drive some to despair and make them believe that mortal will is pointless, it is noted in ancient myth that the gods were slaughtered by the Sher'tul and driven away from our world. Whether or not their absence can be considered a good thing, it cannot be said. There are some surviving stories of the gods' blatant cruelty and complete disregard for the races they made as they squabbled among each other, wrecking great scars across the surface of this world. It is also noteworthy that the gods, despite their impressive power, were not always intelligent beings. Some were believed to be barely sapient, or even sentient. One theory about this is that the gods were primitive beings living on Eyal's surface and just so happened to be infused with antropic energies, artifically elevating them above other primitive lifeforms.

With these things established, we will discuss the gods of Eyal and what influence their actions had, and continue to have, on our world. While I discovered many gods in my studies, it is entirely possible that Eyal had even more gods than what is documented in my findings, but their existence cannot be substantiated by existing scholarly texts.]], [[Gods are beings which have been frequently mentioned throughout Eyal's history.

t([[Ralkur, the god of illusions and deceit, was perhaps the most petty god of Eyal. The myths of Ralkur are often tragedies, describing the downfall of its titular character after trusting a mysterious stranger. Due to the consistency of these stories, it can be concluded that Ralkur did not care for meddling with things on a large scale, but preferred a much smaller one. It delighted in understanding what drove mortal races and how it could bring a single person to ruin with nothing but words and clever lies. It always revealed itself at the end of the tale, its hapless victim realising that they had been fooled all along. In this sense, Ralkur was cruel in a way that was distinct from the other gods.

When the god slayer Branzir came for it, Ralkur came to know fear and fled. The chase between god and god slayer was the stuff of legend, and many myths tell of the great trials which Branzir overcame in his pursuit of Ralkur. In the last moments of the chase, Ralkur was spared and told to leave Eyal by Branzir. However, Ralkur later returned and struck a terrible blow against Branzir's homestead, slaying his family and his servants. The already driven Branzir became obsessed with Ralkur and chased it across the entirety of Eyal. Having nowhere else to run after stumbling into a dungeon, Ralkur chose to go down into Eyal's depths, creating layer upon layer of illusions, creatures and distractions to prevent the relentless Branzir from catching it. Since no one can enter this dungeon without leaving, it can only be guessed at how deep the dungeon has become. Some say it is even infinite and that the chase between hunter and hunted continues to this day.]], [[Ralkur, the god of illusions and deceit, was perhaps the most petty god of Eyal.

While most Eyalites of the current age think of trolls as dumb brutes, they have frequently proven themselves to be far more clever than they're given credit for. The most commonly attributed dominions of Ugg'matho were the forests and mountains of Eyal. In ancient texts, the title bestowed upon it was 'The Gardener,' for it deeply loved the forests and green places of Eyal. It is thought that it created the trolls in its own image, as savage and powerful stewards of the wild places.

In some legends, there are tales of it reaching down from the sky and annihilating settlements, for it saw civilisation as a blemish on the green canvas of Eyal's surface. In others, it instead chose to alter nature itself to stave off civilisation, creating various plants and guardians to prevent sapient races from plundering its forests for resources. The recurring theme of many of its myths is that it was vehemently opposed to sapient beings living out of harmony with nature.

Ugg'matho was frequently in conflict with other gods in its myths. Many a story tells of how the gods and their chosen champions went on great troll hunts in the wilderness, chasing down Ugg'matho's children in order to wipe them from the face of Eyal. While the tales often described their great success in ridding the wilderness of the troll menace, the sheer number of them throughout the ages suggests that they were not as successful as they made out. One myth stated that Ugg'matho eventually struck a deal with the other gods where they would leave its forests alone and it would leave their creations alone in return. Another states that Ugg'matho was made to submit by the other gods and begrudgingly continued to undermine them in secret.

The recurring theme of many of its myths is that it was vehemently opposed to sapient beings living out of harmony with nature.

Ugg'matho was frequently in conflict with other gods in its myths. Many a story tells of how the gods and their chosen champions went on great troll hunts in the wilderness, chasing down Ugg'matho's children in order to wipe them from the face of Eyal. While the tales often described their great success in ridding the wilderness of the troll menace, the sheer number of them throughout the ages suggests that they were not as successful as they made out. One myth stated that Ugg'matho eventually struck a deal with the other gods where they would leave its forests alone and it would leave their creations alone in return. Another states that Ugg'matho was made to submit by the other gods and begrudgingly continued to undermine them in secret.

When Ugg'matho was slained by Branzir, it is said that its blood took on a life of its own, spreading out into the wilderness in the form of living ooze.]], "_t")

Their records state this cataclysm occurred roughly at the same time as the Spellblaze did on Eyal. This suggests that the Spellblaze had far reaching consequences beyond our current understanding and could have impacted multiple worlds.

Despite the benevolent and gentle demeanour he has been attributed in his myths, demons have frequently declared their atrocities committed against Eyalites in his name.

t([[The krog are perhaps the youngest of the intelligent races of Maj'Eyal, only coming into existence recently. They claim that they were formerly ogres that have had their runes removed, somehow surviving having their runes replaced by a combination of natural infusions and drakes blood. The removal of their runes was orchestrated by the Ziguranth, who apparently decided action needed to be taken to prevent all ogres from being horribly and brutally killed as a result of the Spellhunt, leading to the creation of the krog. The official reasons given by the Ziguranth for this action was that the ogres were unfortunate victims of magic rather then perpetrators of it, and the Ziguranth were just looking to help to free them from the taint of the arcane.

Due to the fact that they were originally ogres, it comes as no surprise that the two races share much with each other. They tend to have similar hair coloring, facial features, and other similar traits. The average krog is a bit shorter then a ogre at 8'2" and perhaps a little leaner, but otherwise the rest of their body dimensions remain the same. One would likely be hard pressed to distinguish a krog from an ogre or vice versa if it wasn't for the heavy tint of greens and browns within their eyes and skin, likely a side effect of whatever natural process the Ziguranth employed to strip them of their runes.

The majority of the krog tend to live in or around the middle of the continent where the heart of Ziguranth territory lies and they have been known to take up arms in service to the anti-magic cause. Indeed one may find that the majority of any Ziguranth Patrol one may encounter is usually made up of krog fighters. All krog seem to demonstrate some connection to nature as well as possessing abilities to combat mages, not to mention harbor a huge hatred towards anyone that deals with magic in any way. Indeed, a krog's disdain for the arcane begs the question if perhaps the Ziguranth did a bit more then just remove the runes from their bodies.

Commonly when they are not in the employ of the Ziguranth, or otherwise answering the call to do battle with a rogue mage, the krog have been known to contract themselves out as laborers to whomever may hire them. Like ogres, krog are also known for having impressive appetites and one can find many krog farmers plowing fields to grow food for themselves to eat. They are also known for their talents in mixing infusions, producing the majority of what one might find in the markets around the continent.

Of course no analysis of the krog would be complete without mentioning the many stories, songs, and artwork that revolve around their many pursuits. A lot of encouragement is directed at younger krogs by their peers to venture out into the world and perform heroic deeds. This course of action seems less to do with valor, glory, or riches; something one might expect of a typical 'adventurer' and more to do with the mistrust that followed them formerly being ogres. In an effort to combat their initial image they had as former ogres, the krog sought to commit themselves to gaining a new image through achievement of impressive feats. To this end they seem to have been rather successful as evidenced by the creation of the many artistic works told about them. ]], [[The krog are perhaps the youngest of the intelligent races of Maj'Eyal, only coming into existence recently.

However, perhaps the most unusual of these creatures are the Drem. For the longest time, Drem were presumed to simply be another form of horror which dwelled in Eyal's underground. The recent emergence of thinking Drem, however, has forced many scholars to reassess their race as a whole.

A Drem is roughly the same height as a Dwarf and has a vaguely similar facial structure as well. This is where the similarities between the two races tend to end. Drem have no distinguishing facial features and are incapable of growing beards like dwarves, instead growing wiry and unkempt patches of hair which vary greatly in thickness. Due to the lack of facial features such as eyes, ears, a mouth and a nose, it is not currently known how a Drem eats or how they sense things around them. The mental faculties of thinking Drem seems to vary wildly from each individual as well. Some are barely more capable of rational thought than feral Drem, while others have gained intellect comparable to the brightest minds of Eyal.

As they have only recently come out of their previously mindless states, the Drem are a people who are completely disconnected with the world around them. They possess no cultural identity or history to fall back on and sit on the precipice between the civilised races of Eyal's surface and the horrors of Eyal's underground. Many suspect that they possess some connection to the dwarves, the prevailing theory being that they are some sort of corrupted offshoot of that proud race. There has been little research into the subject and little evidence found to substantiate these claims, however.

I had suspected that we would come across the foul abode of a necromancer or maybe some other form of arcane wielder... But what we found was an abomination unlike any I have seen before.

As we approached the crag, you could practically smell the blight in the air. What little sunlight entered the crag illuminated... something. All I could see was a vast lump of tentacles, writhing and squirming over each other. What I saw next both filled me with disgust and melancholy. The proud form of a drake stood among the mass, but where its head should have been only appeared a mass of tendrils. Its very skin seemed to contain the wriggling mass of some monstrosity. One of nature's proudest creatures, transformed into something which perverted all that is natural and good in this world.

My first instinct was to lead a charge into the crag and cleanse this terrible place, but I knew this would be a mistake. It will pain all of us deeply to not take action now, but there is no sense in throwing our lives away. For now, we must establish camp and observe this threat.]], [[There have often been reports among our brethren about the presence of a magical aberration near the foot of the dwarven mountains.

Most people who make puzzles like these usually leave some hints, but I've got nothing to work with!

So, my approach has been to just keep trying different combinations until something eventually works. I'll record the combination down in this journal and then give it a tick or a cross. That way I can keep track of what works and what doesn't. There had better be an amazing reward for all this work...

t([[So, what does an adventurer do when they get bored with it all? For me, I wanted to find a nice castle somewhere out in the countryside and spend the rest of my days in idle contentment. The issue there is that I made a lot of enemies who would have loved for me to settle down in one spot, so I needed to think of a solution.

That's when I found this place. Everyone else avoided it because people never left once they went inside it. Being used to the adventuring life, I saw such a thing as a challenge. Turns out that this cursed castle, as people referred to it, constantly changes its inside layout. No one really knows how or why it does it, but I'm not really one to question such things. If I could just work out the logic behind how it shifted itself, I could have an unassailable fortress. 

However, I also found that this still didn't deter people from coming to kill me. They all swarmed in and although a lot of them got lost in the hallways, a few actually managed to reach me. I had grown rather attached to the place at this point, but neither could I stay there. My solution came with a bizarre tome I had found in my adventures. When I opened the cover and pointed it in the right direction, it could suck things into its very pages.

So, being the savvy adventurer I am, I opened the tome and sucked the entire castle inside of it. It seems like the tome could only suck so much inside its covers, so it could no longer hold anything else in it. Although I had to sacrifice a great treasure, I now had a sanctuary away from the real world which I could escape to whenever I needed shelter.]], [[So, what does an adventurer do when they get bored with it all?

Some look to uncover knowledge hailing back to the Age of Haze when beings immensely powerful walked Eyal, while others explore the origins of themselves and other races.

Regardless of the subject or method of research, no rules exist to constrain anyone in their approach. This has led to experimentation into what many would deem mad and certainly forbidden among the surface dwellers. If Kroshkkur were to be found it would most certainly be destroyed.

One idea to dealing with the worm is for someone to teleport inside it and make there way towards the worms brain cluster and destroy it.

Combined with the payment received from "Sunny Day," we made a significant profit and reinforced our relationship with "Vapor Trail."

The exchange with "Sherry Toll" was mercifully uneventful, and the goods provided appear to be functional.  With all due respect, Boss, if this doesn't get me a promotion, what will?

"Vapor Trail" has been an eager participant, and we've made a killing off selling Atmos absinthe to the Allied Kingdoms smugglers, as well as selling Elvala wine and brandy to them.  I'll be sending a ship full of our profits (useful metals, alchemical ingredients, slaves) back home on a bi-monthly basis; search the crew to make sure they haven't been lining their pockets, and keelhaul any you catch.

-Crew disobedience and morale continues to be something of a problem, despite regular floggings, but we're still retaining enough of them and getting enough use out of them.

The materials I've shipped home have surely been invaluable for our preparations, and the moment the top brass decides they want to start the invasion, I can start spiking the outgoing liquors and cheerblossom with time-delay potions of your choice, crippling the Allied Kingdoms from within by starting a plague or turning every minor lawbreaker into a berserk madman.  If nothing else, the You-Know-What will be [i]very[/i] useful when push comes to shove.

As per your orders, we've restricted most of our intervention to sabotaging the Allied Kingdoms, but I wonder if some amount of focus on the orcs would be helpful.  A band of them has recently emerged from the Clork Peninsula, victorious over Sun Paladins and Atmos alike; we've lost contact with "Sunny Day," and "Vapor Trail" has kept exports to a minimum for fear of detection.  If we don't do something about this soon, they may become a bigger obstacle than the Allied Kingdoms.

#{italic}#An announcement on power consumption, paid for by the Council of Geothermal Authority#{normal}#

As per our previous announcements, the geothermal vents of the Steam Quarry have begun to taper off in output.  While our geologists and military consider all available options for finding new vents (or alternative sources of steam power), we need YOUR cooperation to keep the pipes from running dry!  Here's how you can help make sure we have enough steam for everyone:

-Cook the old-fashioned way - with flame magic, or a firewood stove.  Flash-steamers, although certainly a convenient way of preparing food, are VERY inefficient.  For a free handbook on delicious and easy-to-learn recipes for a conventional or pyromancy-based stove, simply come to the Council of Geothermal Authority offices and take one from the lobby.

-Remember to shut off your appliances when you're done with them!  A full 5% of our power usage is estimated to be from washing machines, mills, carousels, generator-powered lighting, and other such devices left plugged in when not in use.  When you are done using an appliance, make sure it has been deactivated; to be completely sure, our experts recommend shutting off the valve entirely, then disconnecting the appliance and placing a standard cap over the output pipe.

-Have your pipes checked regularly.  Leaking valves and loose fittings can consume tremendous amounts of steam pressure; you are only required to have your home steam-pipes inspected every three years, but additional inspections are available at no charge (once every six months).  Volunteering for these inspections can reduce your geothermal consumption, and fees, dramatically.

-Use your own steam!  With regular exercise and a good diet, you can create your own power by wearing a collection suit, and plug the pressurized reserve tanks into your home intake valves to reduce the amount of power drawn from the geothermal system by over 40% (depending on personal production).  Short-term use of declogging tonics may help, but long-term use is generally ill-advised.

-Do NOT pressurize tanks from the tap and sell them to others!  This is a violation of Council law, punishable by a fine of up to 3,000 gold and up to four years in prison, per tank.

Thank you for helping ensure we ALL have power, while we work on curing this shortage!]], [[#{bold}#KEEP THE PRESSURE UP!#{normal}#

There are no Ziguranth here in the Far East, and the orcs in this camp have been compliant so far, on account of Mindwall's elaborate illusions.

All you have to do is protect against any stragglers outside the walls looking to break their kin out of here, and patrol the halls to make sure any orcs who've managed to shake off the illusions are swiftly apprehended and dealt with. This should be a pretty easy job - if you need any particular help or provisions, though, let me know and I'll do what I can!

Sincerely,

Listen here, you little cretin.

When we agreed to this, we requested 60 mind-caging helmets, properly sized, alongside 60 sets of mail armor, a minimum of 30 beds, and shifts of no more than eight hours a day. We GOT 35 helmets, and had to send 25 of our guards back lest they get sucked into Mindwall's illusions like these orcs - furthermore, the helmets were crudely modified, and wound up weighing about twice as much as they needed to. We got plate armor instead of mail, further increasing the burden each of us has to carry, and our reduced numbers mean we have to take 12-hour shifts. (Obviously, such a schedule leaves no time for mopping.) Combined with all that, we don't even have enough beds for everyone - depending on the day, 5 to 10 of us are stuck without a place to sleep.

With anyone else, this would be a recipe for a workforce that would quickly get exhausted. Our runes buy us a lot of time before that happens, but that saturation still builds up over time, and we need to rest. We can't just sleep on the floor, we're too big to not get sores from our weight pressing into a hard surface, so each shift, a few of us are stuck without sleep or rest. What you saw in the northwest corner was someone who'd collapsed from exhaustion, who has the longest patrol route and (due to my personal oversight, and I apologize for that) wound up being one of the few who couldn't sleep the previous night.

We know that getting more mind-caging helmets would cost a lot, as would more beds, so we've come up with the cheapest available option to fix this: more chairs. We can get almost as good a rest sleeping in a chair as we can in a bed, provided we throw in the couple of pillows we've managed to make from spare grain sacks. If we don't get this, though, my estimate is that within the next three months, we'll have another guard collapse on a main patrol route, not just that way-out-there one the last guy collapsed on. As in, close enough to the prisoners where his or her helmet might just roll off and into their grasp. And the moment some Orc puts that helmet on, it's all over.

We're fine with these miserable conditions. All things considered, it's still some of the best interpersonal interaction we've gotten outside of Elvala. We'd even be fine with a few of us dying from overwork, if that was the only consequence of such an awful work schedule - but it'd lead to a breakout. And we will NOT be blamed for ANOTHER catastrophe that WASN'T OUR FAULT.

I've said it before, and I'm saying it for the last time: #{bold}#WE NEED MORE CHAIRS IN THE BREAK ROOM.#{normal}# If you think it's too expensive, I will #{italic}#personally#{normal}# come down to your quarters and restrain you while my men confiscate your fancy little bed, desk, and dresser, then repurpose them as scrap lumber and padding to build ourselves some new chairs.

t([[We are not people of great ambition or complex desires, we Minotaurs.  We seek not to choose a direction for the world, we wish not to spread across the land, we are content not to build great machines or greater empires.  What we wish more than anything is simply to live; alas, the rest of the world wishes that we do not.  We cannot say where or how the hostilities started...  if we had to guess, perhaps the soft-footed considered us a pest for seeking out homes in their storerooms and armories.  We are drawn to great magic, especially when it is concentrated into artifacts, and over the eons of persecution, we have developed an equally strong instinctual drive towards safe places underground (although, again, this is simply a guess).  If there is enough stray magic around, we can live on it without eating or drinking, and see no need to come to the surface; indeed, under such conditions we might not even age.  Most minotaur tribes that find a safe habitat - glowing with magic, and filled with enough dark twisting passages that the soft-footed will not come down in force - discover that they no longer need cooperation to survive, and slowly lose themselves to instinct; for a long time, it was only our willpower that made us different, and even that was beginning to wane.  In a way, maybe what happened to us was genuinely a blessing.

We cannot tell you how long ago it was, as we did not write down our history at that time, and we had more pressing concerns soon after.  At some point, though, we felt a home, better than any we'd ever felt before, through a long, long series of caverns and tunnels.  The magic here... it was incredible!  It...  well, you do not have a word for it, but "tasted" is close enough - different than anything we'd absorbed before, hearty and rich, and it soaked into our tired bodies so easily.  We did not even need to stop to rest, it kept us so rejuvenated...  so we kept going down, losing track of how far it was.  In truth, I think we walked the length of a continent, if not more, cheerfully pressing onward, eager to see what awaited us at the end.

If only we'd noticed that what we were feeling wasn't rejuvenation.

Our leader, Garnok of the Stormy Fist, was the first to fall victim to it, and if he hadn't done so in such dramatic fashion, we may have all been lost.  His eyes became frantic and wandering as we walked onward, and he began making odd, pained grunts before stumbling and falling.  We heard a crack, and suspected that he may have broken an arm; we dashed closer to him, but stopped when his back and shoulders bulged and shifted, shortly before several tentacles burst from him, covered in the blood, fur, and skin that they dragged with them.  He simply pushed himself up with these new appendages, as though nothing was wrong.

We backed away from him, and he grew wild, grabbing at Karbatha the One-Horned and surging that unfamiliar magic that saturated these caverns; at once, a strange creature burst forth, separating the two before hovering over us.  He made false promises to us as Nektosh ran to his sister's side, claiming that Garnok's fate was a gift, and asking us to join him.

We are simple, but we are not fools.  We ran; we felt a wave of magic surge forth, sickly like rotten meat, and Karbatha cried out in her brother's arms.  We kept running, as the tunnels bent back and forth, spiraling upward, until we were certain the creature had lost sight of us...  and then we heard a message in our minds.  "It's too late.  The blessing is already within you, and these tunnels are far too long to escape before it takes root.  Come back, so we can guide it into a form you will find pleasing."  And from deeper back in the tunnels, we heard a bellow from what used to be Garnok.

As we examined ourselves, feeling tiny hints of that blighted magic within us all, Nektosh took Karbatha away to a hastily-assembled tent, and she...  well, she was gone.  After the commotion ended, he strode out and gave a remarkably lucid assessment: the magic seemed to only work on the living.  Karbatha's illness stopped when her heart did...  and although it was certainly a drastic idea, if we couldn't purge this curse through some other means, we had to consider purging the life it fed on instead.

He was not our only necromancer, but the idea was still nearly unthinkable...  until we realized that it was growing.  There were no visible signs, our bodies and minds were resisting it...  but it was only a matter of time, and perhaps even less time for Nektosh.

We reluctantly agreed, and he prepared the spells and potions needed to keep us mostly as we were, but bereft of life.  Preserved, strong, even feeling and smelling when most liches could not..  but still cut off from Nature's gifts entirely, and still incapable of bearing young.  This generation would not age to death, but it would nonetheless be our last.  He volunteered to be the last one, only instructing another of us on how to convert him once all of us had been treated...  Whether it was because the infection had more time to fester within him, or because of what he suffered through in his sister's tent, Nektosh has never really been the same since then.

In a cruel twist of fate, we found what would have been paradise not long after our escape - the Mana Caves, laden with magic, but we only needed a tenth of it now as we did alive.  Nonetheless, it has been our home ever since...  most soft-feet would have raided the caverns and wiped us out like common vermin, but the Kruk Pride treated us with respect and dignity that perhaps no minotaur OR undead creature has received before (let alone the combination).  We are still a reclusive people, and our current state gives us even fewer reasons to need trade with them...  but they are the closest thing we have ever had to friends, and I suspect that right now, we are that to them as well.]], [[We are not people of great ambition or complex desires, we Minotaurs.

Cheer!  CHEER, DAMN YOU!

Now...  as your new Lord, you are lucky that I am a merciful one.  I grant you all a tremendous honor, the opportunity to serve me and personally witness the fall of all who would oppose me.  Gone are the days of hiding from the Steam Giants, gone are the days of treating those Kruk Orcs as equals.  Gone are the days of the living claiming dominion over this world; they shall bow to us for the mercy of being made undead, or I shall personally annihilate them.

t([[To think such an advanced civilization was hiding nearly right under our noses!  Not that the proximity made it any easier for me to conduct my research - it seems that unless you're a Sunwall citizen, a blood relative of King Tolak, or a merchant with enough gold to bribe the guards to look the other way, it's nearly impossible for a civilian to use the portal to the East.  Fortunately, Grand Councilor Kasyros himself was shown my writings to give him a basic overview of all the species his people were unfamiliar with, and he requested my presence to study his people.

Steam Giants are strikingly similar to what humans would look like, were they 8-10 feet tall and slightly on the stocky side (in contrast to the gangly, yet deceptively strong giants of Daikara).  Their most distinguishing physical trait is almost certainly their steam, for which they are named - their skin has numerous pores and vents which are capable of emitting pressurized steam.  They have limited conscious control over this; at rest they are nearly invisible and emit either a gentle mist or nothing at all, but they can will them to seal shut or distend widely, which, in addition to being rather disconcerting to watch, emits a stream or burst of pressurized steam.

Rather ingeniously, they have figured out how to use this steam to power and operate a wide array of metallic contraptions.  Although the giants' oldest texts have been lost to occasional fires and other disasters, they claim that the first bit of "steam-tech" was a simple whistle; from there, they discovered a sort of pressurized stone-cleaner, and from there more and more complex contraptions.  A similar effect can theoretically be achieved by using a furnace to boil water, but this method requires attention and adjustment that comes as naturally to the Steam Giants as breathing; perhaps it is this intuitive quality that made it so easy for them to accomplish so much with it.

The Steam Giants of the Atmos Tribe have hidden in the Clork mountains for ages; it is truly fortunate for them that the Spellblaze missed them entirely, for they were so concentrated and so few in number that it surely would have eradicated them.  They have kept their interactions with other races to a minimum; while Grand Councilor Kasyros claims this was due to fear of both what the outside world could do to them, and what their careless intervention could do to outsiders, most of the other Atmos I spoke to claimed to merely find the "lesser races" to be boorish and unpleasant.  (This is an entirely understandable view, seeing as their only neighbors until just recently have been Orcs.) 

While this isolation has given them peace to let their society develop, it has also fostered a strain of sophistry and disconnection to reality, according to Kasyros, who has begun open trade with the Sunwall and Allied Kingdoms to grant his citizens some fresh perspective.  I could not hope to fully analyze this society during my brief stay; the only deeper insight worth noting I was able to see is that they value physical fitness almost exactly as much as intellectual pursuits, perhaps owing to the fact that steam-tech can be made more powerful through more efficient construction OR simply being able to force out more steam from one's vents.  Their government, accordingly, is chosen by an apparent compromise between democracy and bloodsport (aside from a brief period under King Traglamar, which Kasyros would only tell me "was deeply embarassing for all involved").  Although I cannot say how it reflects on the Atmos people in a greater sense, I feel I must make special note that they have learned how to make the best absinthe I have ever tasted.

Alas, I was not able to study them for long enough to learn more than this.  Kasyros tells me he cannot accompany me any longer, for he has arranged a meeting with the Hero of Maj'Eyal - something about using an exploratory farportal for disposal purposes?  Whatever the case, although most of our contact with the Atmos is still done via constructs dropped from airships, we will soon gain the opportunity to meet more of them in person, and perhaps outsiders other than myself will soon be allowed to see their cities for themselves.

t([[Our pride has never been held in high esteem by the others.  We were the backbone of Garkul's army, the supply-runners, the road-builders, the medics tending to the wounded - all roles that had to be done to support those who gloriously fought in the thick of battle...  Alas, all this meant is that the others only barely accepted our necessity, barely concealing their distaste for us "cowards" and "weaklings."  Garkul stood up for us whenever the opportunity arose, so their prejudices were a moot point until his defeat; unfortunately, once the Allied Kingdoms started pushing us back and attacking the fortified towns we'd built in Maj'Eyal, we took the blame for not making them strong enough to hold off all attackers.  "What good are they?"  Rak'shor once asked.  "Even when they're hiding behind us, they still can't make anything worthwhile!"  When it was revealed that our then-leader had held off the Allied Kingdoms at one of their strongholds to buy enough time for most of our Pride's women and children to retreat to Var'Eyal, by way of launching ancient Nargol golems into human ranks via trebuchet, the accusations of cowardice gave way to ones of selfishness and betrayal.  We kept quiet about them, hoping to change their minds when rebuilding Orcish towns in Var'Eyal, hoping that they would come to see reason when they had roofs over their heads and wells to drink from, courtesy of our Pride; it seemed to work for the time being.  We kept our distance from the others, building our own homes in a distant corner of the continent, and only sending small groups out to do minor repair and construction.  The walls we built were strong enough to keep the Sunwall forces from simply walking over them, and that seemed to be enough.

Alas, this acceptance would neither grow nor last.  One fateful night, Grand Architect Kruk came running back after a meeting with the other leaders of the Prides, saying we had to leave immediately, and that the women had to go first.  To this day, we are not entirely certain what drove her to such a panic...  she only told us that we would never want peace with the other Prides if we knew what we were running from, and that we may need that peace someday.  We swiftly built a bridge to the Clork Peninsula over the next few days, looking back over our shoulders towards the other Prides as we worked, and on the night the last Orc made it across, Kruk set it ablaze with burning arrows.  On the distant shore, we could only see the torches of those who we had narrowly escaped.

We barely had time to sigh in relief before a thunderous noise roared above us, and a bright light came down from the sky, lighting us up but leaving the surrounding land dark.  A curious sort of golem fell from it, made of springs and gears rather than runes and stone.  It spoke with a scratchy yet organic-sounding voice, asking what had happened and what had caused the lights and noises in the dead of night; we told it we had fled the mainland for our own safety, and that we were only looking for a place to exist.  Hooks descended from the whirring airship above, dragging the construct back up, and it left without another word.

We found a suitable home on the far side of the mountain range, shielded by the surrounding hills and yet fertile enough to sustain us.  Once we had settled in, the airships and constructs began visiting us more and more often, at first simply watching, then conversing with us and even helping us build homes.  It was not too long until one of the constructs' masters finally came to speak with us in person; he introduced himself as one of the Atmos, the Steam Giants we'd assumed for so long to be merely an ancient myth.  They were a strange people, and one we began to admire as we became fast friends.  Wise and reasoned yet valuing strength, neither overly arrogant nor overly timid...  a bit on the frivolous and eccentric side, but living for countless ages alone on a mountaintop would do that to anyone, we reasoned.  Likewise, they seemed to think of us as their rambunctious but gifted children, and when they began to teach us of their steam-pressure-driven machinery, they were impressed by how quickly we adapted to and improved on it.  They gave us guidance and wisdom, we gave them drive and innovation; we could have become true allies, if we'd only had enough time.

All good things must come to an end, it seems.  One day, a panicked scout ran into our camp and announced that an Orcish army had arrived by boat on the shores of the Clork Peninsula, and was charging toward us with hostile intent.  Whatever they had originally wanted that drove Grand Architect Kruk away, they were no longer content to go without it.

We told the Atmos, and they told us to simply reason with them; they had clearly never been under attack!  We would obtain no assistance from them, not even when our lives clearly depended on it.  Instead, Grand Architect Kruk showed us a series of schematics she'd made, ones that she dared not reveal before for fear of the Atmos seeing them - ones showing how to turn our helpful steam contraptions into hideously effective weaponry.  A harness to wear the great whirling lumber-saws as weapons, portable steam generators so we could power our machinery like the Atmos could without being tethered to a pipe or hose, a means of removing the safety mechanisms on nail-guns and swapping their barrels out so they could fire sling-bullets at incredible speeds, a giant version of the jewelry-plating device they gave us that could electrocute dozens of invaders at once...

We held strong when the other Prides came for us, and we were fighting with weapons they had never encountered before, inflicting wounds they had never learned to tolerate or heal, fighting with forces that they could not hope to even understand, let alone fight.  The shrieking din of sawblades shredding through armor and severing limbs, the screams of Gorbat's wyrm-riders as giant grappling hooks pulled them out of the sky, the smell of Orcish flesh cooked through to the core by lightning or scalded by jets of steam, the rattling of steamguns as they turned an attacking formation into a pile of corpses - these sensations might haunt the nightmares of Atmos and the other Prides, but to us they were the sweet sounds, sights, and smells of victory and safety.  We had prevailed, with only a handful dead on our side before they fled.  Kruk Pride would not be conquered.

The Atmos, however, did not see the dire circumstances we were in.  They did not see the threat we faced, and I doubt that even if the Grand Architect of the Pride had told them what she knew, they would have listened.  All they saw was their tools of creation being used to destroy, their beautiful inventions being used for something so monstrous, their darling clever "children" causing bloody carnage on a scale hundreds of times greater than they'd ever seen.  They denounced us, and those who had begun to mingle with us promptly retreated back to the mountains.  We were no longer welcome using their technology, and perhaps not even living near their mountains.

We will miss their company, their ancient wisdom, and their cautious kindness.  We will not miss their squeamish ignorance and pompous self-righteousness.]], [[Our pride has never been held in high esteem by the others.

t([[A Plea from the Volunteer's Bureau of Gaming:

Once again, we find ourselves faced with an election for the competition of Chief Councilor.  While this is the most prestigious position in our government, it should not be forgotten that is also arguably the most complex, and the one bearing the greatest responsibility for the fate of our people.  A Chief Councilor's duties require not only cautious, reasoned foresight, but a quick wit to get emergencies under control in little time; yet, he or she must be aware of the precedent set or the unintended consequences of such decisive action, never acting rashly or out of ill temper.  Such a leader would wield our citizens and our military like a drunkard with a glass bottle, not caring if his weapon is shattered in the process. He or she must be able to develop creative solutions to problems but be open to outside advice, to be a character judge capable of selecting his or her most valuable acquaintances and a persuader to convince them to do the tasks for which they are most suited...  suffice to say, there are a great many mental skills required.  Accordingly, the competition should be one that tests all these skills.

This election, we are formally endorsing the board game [i]Automobiles and Automatons v9.8,[/i] a refined variant of the game introduced last year in a competition for the Marshall of the City Guard.  Its "oil-punk" science-fantasy setting, although perhaps easy to brush off as irrelevant to our reality, has its own consistent internal rules, forcing its players to learn a new status quo and work with it, as our leaders must be willing to learn from ongoing events and rapidly adapt to them; yet, since the game has been out for a year already and there are already numerous books about strategies for it, it also tests our candidates' long-term memory, as our leaders must be able to remember our history, to repeat our ancestors' successes but not their failures.  The rules of v9.8 are somewhat, but not entirely, different from those of previous versions, making these strategy books only partially accurate, just as our ancestors' wisdom only reflected the world they lived in, not the increasingly different one of the present.

v9.8 uses the "Crumbling Divide" map, providing a barrier that eliminates the possibility of an aggressive player gaining an early victory, tests the players' ability to plan in the long term, and yet due to the presence of non-player foes on either side, they still must be able to make plans in the short-term that will ensure their survival and leave them in an advantageous position when the barrier fades.  Non-player foes follow a predictable set of rules, eliminating luck as a factor, and our necropsychs have found a method of copying the same spiritual consciousness into two figurines, meaning that both players will be using identical sets of Negotiator figurines to demonstrate their diplomatic finesse.  (As always, the figurines are designed to release their spirits after no more than one month, ensuring that this process is as humane as possible to the deceased.)

The consumer edition of this game, v6.0, has won countless awards for its engaging and challenging play, with special attention given to the diverse array of viable strategies and skills tested by it.  Both sides agreed it was a fair game in the Marshall's election, as v1.0; v9.8 is unlikely to disappoint as a method of selecting our next leader.  Vote for [i]Automobiles and Automatons v9.8[/i] this year, and you will not be let down by its winner.]], [[A Plea from the Volunteer's Bureau of Gaming:

v9.8 uses the "Crumbling Divide" map, providing a barrier that eliminates the possibility of an aggressive player gaining an early victory, tests the players' ability to plan in the long term, and yet due to the presence of non-player foes on either side, they still must be able to make plans in the short-term that will ensure their survival and leave them in an advantageous position when the barrier fades.  Non-player foes follow a predictable set of rules, eliminating luck as a factor, and our necropsychs have found a method of copying the same spiritual consciousness into two figurines, meaning that both players will be using identical sets of Negotiator figurines to demonstrate their diplomatic finesse.  (As always, the figurines are designed to release their spirits after no more than one month, ensuring that this process is as humane as possible to the deceased.)

The consumer edition of this game, v6.0, has won countless awards for its engaging and challenging play, with special attention given to the diverse array of viable strategies and skills tested by it.  Both sides agreed it was a fair game in the Marshall's election, as v1.0; v9.8 is unlikely to disappoint as a method of selecting our next leader.  Vote for [i]Automobiles and Automatons v9.8[/i] this year, and you will not be let down by its winner.]], "_t")

t([[My fellow councilors,

In this time of increasing vent-drought, it is tempting for us to seek the easy way out.  I understand that at this point, I am powerless to prevent our new Chief Councillor's plans to take the promising vents under the Kruk orcs, but should we fail, you may be tempted to compensate by approaching that...  entity who called itself "the Loyalist."  I am of the opinion that this would be a foolish decision.

Do you remember the Official Histories' record of when we first interacted with the lesser races?  They spoke of them as an entertaining, jovial bunch, friends and companions with our own people.  How naive we were back then...  but when our ancestors saw their true nature, the brutality they were capable of, they recorded these acts in detail.  They did not, however, explicitly tell us not to trust the Orcs.  They did not explicitly tell us that they are pests to be avoided, or a scourge to be eradicated, or a pitiful, fallen reminder of why letting the lesser races use our discoveries will only end in tragedy.  They simply recorded what they learned, and allowed future generations to come to those conclusions themselves, compared with their own observations - and in our grandparents' case, by unfortunate personal experience.  Even through the distress and feelings of betrayal at the time, even though opinions ran in every direction from fury to sorrow at the lesser races' barbarism, not one of the Councilors responsible for recording events gave in to editorialism.  Perhaps we would be in a better situation if they had, so we would have not repeated their mistake of trust, but they stayed fair nonetheless.

Going even further back, they spoke of relations with our now-distant kin, the Sturmos Tribe.  Though the records describe a strained relationship, the mentions of their boorish behavior are recorded in a matter-of-fact nature, and interspersed with the mentions of their advanced metallurgy techniques and other such valuable things we gained from cooperating with them.  Although their current state of Great Firestorm-induced exile to the mountains of Maj'Eyal makes it a rather moot point, the fact still stands that if we were somehow in a position to trade with them, we could rely on the Official Histories for a trustworthy indication of, at a minimum, how they [i]used[/i] to behave.

The examples go on; the Official Histories have remained dispassionate and fair, and a reliable metric for making decisions.  Not once did our forefathers allow their biases to influence their recordings.  Not once did a fervent political movement manage to compromise their integrity.  Not one chapter of these texts can be safely and fully discredited as the subjective, unfair writings of a dominant political party, or the deluded ramblings of a movement influenced by some banal philosophical fad.

(Obviously, the mercifully brief reign of King Traglamar is an exception, but it should be clear why this was a special case and not worthy of further consideration.)

My point is, the Official Histories have a very well-proven track record.  Every single time but once, they have given a solid analysis of the evidence.  Every single time but once, they have refrained from outright suggesting a course of action.  And only once have they allowed something as subjective as a gut feeling into their reports.

Do you know what they say about the meeting with the Loyalist?  After a brief description of the events of the meeting - a strange creature approaching the Council of the time, demonstrating its power by using a small wand to blast a hole halfway to Eyal's core (a wand which he then handed them as though it were a child's cheaply-made toy), stating it could offer us a source of near-infinite energy in return for a rather inconvenient magical artifact.  When they turned it down, the creature gave a speech recorded in verbatim detail: "It hardly matters.  I have all the time in the world to wait for your people to trip over their own hubris and shatter.  If you will not allow me to save you, then I need only sift through the shards of your ruined cities to find it."

Our forefathers say this creature gave them a means of contacting it again, but outright refuse to say what it was; the only reason we still know how to reach it is the yearly messages dropped on the Palace's front steps.  After mentioning that, they wrote this:

"Do not trust this Loyalist.  When we look upon him, we feel something deep within us, older than ourselves, telling us that he is simply... [i]wrong[/i].  His intentions with the Eye, an artifact with incredible power that we have yet to successfully harness, cannot be good for anyone, least of all ourselves.  Never give him the Eye, and continue our work of trying to find a means of destroying it.  Never accept any other deal he offers.  If you are ever unfortunate enough to see him as well, you will immediately understand why we say this."

Perhaps political discourse has gotten a bit...  muddier in recent years.  With the bickering and sniping of modern-day debates, it can be hard to believe that past Councilors had ideas other than their careers in mind, that a vehement display of emotion would be something other than political posturing.  But even if those Councilors were just as petty and selfish as we are, they did not let it affect the Official Histories, not once.

The Master, a necromancer of terrible power and even more terrible sadism, waited for <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?> there with an army of the undead, clutching an ancient weapon of incredible power...  but <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?> bravely pressed on, cutting through the hordes of skeletons and ghouls, prevailing where so many others had failed.  Eventually, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> stood victorious over the vampire's body, and took the Staff of Absorption with <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?>, safely away from undead hands.  Maj'Eyal was safe once more.

Unfortunately, what awaited <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?> next was a quest with even greater stakes.  Orcs, a once-thought-vanquished threat, had reappeared in force in Maj'Eyal!  Despite <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?>'s best efforts to store the staff in a safe place, the orcs stole it, and <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?> was forced to follow them all the way through an ancient, impossibly advanced Farportal to get it back.  The portal crackled and whirled as <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?> held up the Orb of Many Ways to activate it; <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> took a deep breath, closed <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.hisher?> eyes, and a moment later, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> became the first person to go from Maj'Eyal to Var'Eyal, the distant continent of the Far East, in centuries.

A long-lost band of allies, the people of Sunwall, awaited <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?> there - as did four armies of orcs!  Once again, though, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?> refused to back down when the fate of the world was in <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.hisher?> hands.  Blessed by High Paladin Aeryn, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> set out to reclaim the Staff of Absorption from the Orcish Prides.  Storms of fire and ice assaulted <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?> on <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.hisher?> way to challenge the grand magus Vor, a foe who could call forth the heavens themselves to pulverize <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?>, but his meteors weren't enough to stop <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?>; the dragon-tamers of Gorbat Pride, master wyrmics with unparalleled control over the forces of Nature, merely gave <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?> the opportunity to become the world's most accomplished dragonslayer.  The bone fortress of Rak'Shor Pride crumbled as <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> put its inhabitants to rest, and even when orcs stood in <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.hisher?> way to do what orcs are best known for at Grushnak Pride, their brute force with strength and steel was simply not strong enough.
<? if not Lore.pocket_time_winner.sacrifice then ?>
But right as <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> set out to climb the tower, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> got an urgent message from High Paladin Aeryn!  <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.HeShe?> journeyed across the wastes of Eruan with haste, arriving at another farportal.  Without a thought to where it led, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?> rushed in at her orders; <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> found <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?>self in a vast plain of fire and magma, with a narrow stretch of land leading far into the distance.  Behind <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?>, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> heard clanging and crashing - the orcs were after <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?> even here, and the Sun Paladins were valiantly holding the line to keep them away.  They told <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?> to do one thing: run!  And run <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> did, cutting through and sidestepping countless great red drakes in the process, the glowing magma spitting and bubbling on either side of the perilous stony bridge.  At the end, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> caught the sight of the Staff for the first time since Maj'Eyal - and the culprits were, surprisingly, a human and an elf!  These two sorcerers, driven by a combination of good intentions, sheer madness, and tragic love, had manipulated the Orc Prides into stealing the staff for them - to what end, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> still did not know.  Nonetheless, the spell they were channeling was thwarted, and <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> returned to the East victorious, ready to assault the sorcerers' lair of the High Peak.

Threats even greater than any <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> had faced before awaited <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?>.  The tower itself was trying to stop <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?>, changing conditions assaulting <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.hisher?> defenses on each floor, combined with an army of every foe imaginable, but <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> would not be hindered, and pushed past everything on <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.hisher?> final ascent.  On the top floor, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?> was finally met with the sorcerers, Argoniel and Elandar, face-to-face.  They told <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.himher?> of their plans with the staff, ones far more dangerous than mere global domination - no, they sought to bring back a threat that only the long-gone Sher'Tul could have dealt with.  A threat long forgotten, lost and tumbling between the stars: Gerlyk, a god driven mad from isolation.  They had to be stopped!

Fortunately, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?> did not go into this battle alone.  High Paladin Aeryn arrived to fight by <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.hisher?> side, and the four of them clashed in a fight for the fate of Eyal.  Even with Argoniel's fearsome bone-armor whirling around her, even with Elandar's impressive spells flying through the air, even with the portals summoning foes of all sorts to join the battle...  in the end, the forces of good prevailed.  The sorcerers were defeated, and the portal was sealed, forever.

Eyal had been saved, thanks to <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.name?>.  Most of the world may not have known what happened at the top of High Peak, but they were in the grips of peril, and were now free of it.  None can say what our champion did after that...  but whatever it was, <?=Lore.pocket_time_winner.heshe?>, and all life on Eyal, lived happily ever after.

This forest is the site of a massive and ongoing ecological disaster.  As far as I can tell (and as a Mender, I have at least [i]some[/i] clue of what I'm talking about), Eyal's trying to fight off an infection, and the infection's fighting back for all it's worth.  Given the indiscriminate hostility of the local treants, we can assume the infection's winning, if only slightly; it's concentrated most of its power into a handful of crystalline avatars at the top of the great tree.  Best case scenario, Eyal's pushing them out like splinters, and destroying these avatars will eliminate the problem; worst case, the tree is already infected down to its roots, and these avatars are its spores, growing until they're ready to leave the tree and spread elsewhere.  I came to destroy these crystals myself, but I wasn't counting on the treants turning on me as well; since you're reading this, congratulations!  This is your responsibility now.

My advice?  Head through the portal to Shatur and call for backup.  I don't have that option, as that'd require incriminating myself by admitting that I was in Var'Eyal without a pass (you wouldn't judge me if you knew how much the trolls were paying for cheerblossom).  I can assure you that the others there are considerably more dedicated and competent than I am, even if only as a group; together, they'll be able to control this infection and treat the wounds it's left behind.  If you go in alone, you'll likely get ripped apart by the treants before you can even reach the trunk - and more are waking up every passing minute.  Unless you're the Hero of Maj'Eyal or Garkul's reanimated corpse, you'll be walking into your own grave.  Let the professionals handle this.

If you insist on going in, though, here's what I know:

-The treants, unfortunately, are no longer concerned with discerning friend from foe.  Anything not stemming from Nature is a potential source of the infection in their eyes, and must be purged before they can slumber once more.  I know that saying "please" isn't exactly sufficient for asking you not to defend yourself...  just try to keep the damage to a minimum, so they can heal the land once ravaged by this sickness.  If you want to avoid them, get off the ground level and into the canopy as soon as you can; they won't animate if they don't see anything on the forest floor to attack.  Also, do NOT try to take a core sample!  Trust me on this - as much as I wanted to know how deep the infection had spread, whether it was all the way through the tree or if it had pushed it all to the top, it attracted the treants to me like Shaloren to a stupid decision.  

-The destructive agent in question is a group of animated arcane crystals, of the type previously documented in the Scintillating Caverns.  The exact processes involved in their formation are still unclear, but it's a safe assumption that they're connected to the massive surge of blight introduced by the Spellblaze, and proof that even now, the damage is most likely worse than we can ever be sure of.  Expect to take powerful blasts of every kind of magic if you're not exceptionally evasive; fortunately, although they frequently teleport, they are completely immobile between blinks.  If one teleports near you, either take cover, or destroy it before it can reposition itself.

-The consequences of letting this go unchecked would be disastrous.  Even if this great tree's growth IS a sign of the planet successfully fighting the infection off by pushing it out, the crystalline avatars could simply climb down, bury themselves, and sicken Eyal once more.  And if Eyal's losing...  as much as I loathe to say it, perhaps those Shaloren pyromaniacs could do some good for once in their all-too-long lives, and cauterize the area down to the roots.  Provided, of course, that they can figure out how to do so without blowing up the sun.

I wish you luck, and thank you for doing what I cannot.  There are reasons why this is a risk I cannot afford to take, but it's probably best for both of us that you assume I'm a coward.  It's not too far from the truth.

With unending gratitude,
(This is where I would sign my name, were I an utter moron.)

PS: If you wouldn't mind doing me a personal favor, please destroy any written articles you find.  They spilled out of my bag as I fled; I'm already a coward, and I'd rather not be a litterer as well.]], [[WARNING - READ THIS!

t([[EYAL NEEDS YOU!

The damage left in the Scintillating Caverns, in Norgos' Lair, and in countless other places has only now become clear, after the Hero of Maj'Eyal made them safe to explore once more.  Now that peace has been brought to these lands, Eyal is beginning to heal - but with the arrival of our magic-using cousins from the East and the Allied Kingdoms' growing acceptance of magic, the balance may once more tip towards ruin - but YOUR help can keep Eyal healthy!  Join the Menders, and start helping the planet today!

LEARNING AND OBSERVING

Our founders, once Guardians of Shatur, have always known the importance of maintaining a balanced ecosystem.  Do your hobbies include birdwatching, exploring the wilderness, and taking in the sights of natural flora?  We can provide you with a list of animals, plants, and fungi of interest; simply go out and write down where you explored, when, and how many of these species you saw.  Our experienced naturalists can use this information to track migration patterns and monitor the spread or decline of those species, allowing us to take action if one becomes endangered or invasive; already, they're working to restore the balance disrupted by the Hero of Maj'Eyal's constant slaying of local wildlife.  Change is inherent to the natural order; our experts know to only step in if a change would drastically and destructively hurt the ecosystem.  Nature solves most of its problems on its own, but occasionally we may need to hold its hand (particularly in response to mutations caused by unchecked use of arcane magic).  If you'd like to learn more about the natural order, we have a diverse community of knowledgeable naturalists who are happy to answer questions or provide a more thorough education.

REPAIRING AND HEALING

Volunteers who prefer a more hands-on approach can expect to start making a difference right away, by joining our reclamation and decontamination efforts.  It's no secret that the Hero of Maj'Eyal's many battles took their unfortunate toll; many places are still littered with magic-contaminated objects or bodies, and in some places the ground itself has been polluted by the residual effects of these spells.  (This is, of course, to say nothing of the trees burned down, etc. by beasts and ne'er-do-wells trying to stop the Hero!)  You can help by destroying dangerously magical objects, planting trees, slaying ecologically-disruptive beasts (such as Norgos), and participating in cleansing rituals to speed up the healing process.

ABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY, AND ACCEPTANCE

The wilds of Eyal are a dangerous place; we do not expect our scholars to go into them defenseless!  For those who are already accustomed to use of the arcane, our partnership with the Living Fossils allows us to identify safe and responsible methods of using magic, and provide them with an introduction to the ways of Nature, and those who are already adept with Nature can always hone their skills with our veteran members.  If you have no ability with either, you're in luck!  We're eager to show you how to accept Nature's favors to defend yourself.  Anyone can learn to summon loyal beasts or channel wyrmic strength if they're willing to try!  These abilities can be used without giving up your attunement to the arcane, but you may find that you don't need your spells anymore, once you've seen how effective Nature's power is.  We will never force you to give up magic, but if you happen to be looking for a greater commitment, speak to your instructor about following the path of the oozemancer.

t([[We recognize that times are changing.  Within a year, the Allied Kingdoms have gone from begrudgingly tolerating magic to openly embracing it, due to the influence of our rediscovered allies in the East.  Furthermore, if the reports are to be believed, the ecosystem of Var'Eyal remains healthy and intact, despite millennia of continuous magic-use.  Therefore, our views and approach must change with the times; we are not ignorant to new knowledge.

At this point, it should go without saying that reckless use of magic is a dire threat to...  everything, more or less.  Eyal has yet to fully recover from even the rampant necromancy of the Age of Dusk, let alone the Spellblaze itself.  Eliminating all use of magic is the only way to be safe from this situation repeating...  but it is possible that lesser uses of arcane magic do not have any inherent corrupting or harmful effect, judging from the Sun Paladins and Anorthil.  They have, contrary to our long-held beliefs, managed to use magic responsibly and safely.  We are not so blind as to deny that this is an incredible reassurance.  That said, this proves nothing about the most terrible potential of magic.  Maybe no Sun Paladin or Anorthil has yet sunk to the depths of depravity of the Age of Dusk sorcerers, or the tragically reckless mages responsible for the Spellblaze, but that is no indication that their magic does not have the potential for abuse.  

Fortunately, there is an alternative available!  With the proper respect, care, and concentration given to Nature, one can be rewarded with powers rivaling or besting the popular uses of magic.  On the civilian level, summoned fireflies can replace magical lighting, regeneration salves can replace healing spells, and accelerated crop growth makes for a far more nutritious diet than conjured foodstuffs.  For martial purposes, there's very little that can stand up to the powers of Nature.  An experienced disciple of Eyal can summon loyal beasts faster than any mage can blast them, crush spellswords of all types with draconic might, or dissolve a necromancer's army in a tide of corrosive ooze.  And if the disciple in question is familiar with the practices of the Ziguranth...  We do not condone their approach to defending nature, but their techniques speak for themselves when facing a hostile mage.  The best part about these abilities, though, is that they are self-limiting!  There is no potential for a runaway chain reaction, or a lone megalomaniac destroying much of Eyal.  The planet willingly gives us its power, and is conscious enough to take it away if we start abusing its gifts.  Even the most powerful of Wilders cannot abuse their power to the perverse degree that a necromancer can.

Thus, we're putting our efforts into two areas.  The first is advocacy of Natural alternatives to magic, talking to spellcasters to determine what they use magic for and figuring out ways to use Nature's abilities to do the same task just as well (if not moreso).  We've continued the Ziguranth efforts to make all-natural replacements for Ogric runes (we predict that life expectancy is now only reduced by 40% with our newest mixtures), developed fertilizing recipes that outperform arcane methods of producing food, created wells near desert settlements otherwise dependent on water magic, and developed so many other techniques and applications that make magic just as obsolete as it is hazardous.  The second is minimizing the harm done by the arcane, by educating spellcasters on the safe, responsible, and Nature-conscious use of magic.  Not every spellcaster is evil, and in fact, some may enrich the lives of those around them!  Runic magic is at least somewhat self-limiting, and we are working with the Living Fossils guild in hopes of developing a new type of magic, one inherently linked to and limited by Nature.  Their stone-wardens have maintained perfect harmony with Nature despite constant use of the arcane; if this is truly the way forward, then we shall welcome it with open arms.

Another vandalized poster.  Calling us traitors, collaborators, declaring themselves the True Ziguranth.  Fools, the lot of them.

When I established the Menders, it wasn't because I thought the arrival of a handful of magic-users who also happen to be decent people disproved anything taught in Zigur or my childhood in Shatur.  It wasn't because I suddenly forgot that anything derived from arcane magic, no matter whether or not it's wrapped up in some mumbo-jumbo about the heavens, carries the risk of mutating into something that could put the Spellblaze to shame.  It was because those maniacs had ignored the shifting political tides for so long that they found themselves sliding into irrelevance, then went and skipped directly over irrelevance into pariahdom with that foolhardy assassination attempt.  They can blame the Far East all they want, but that was only the last nail in the coffin, alongside widespread acceptance of runes and alchemists operating openly across the continent.

I can appreciate their dedication.  I can appreciate their frustration, and how seeing the world treating magic-use as normal would just make them want to get more violent - but the fact is, the raid on Zigur was a mercy kill, preventing the fanatics from making us look even worse in the public eye.  We are long past the point where intimidation can get us anywhere - so we need to try a new approach.  If reminding the world of the horrors of magic isn't working anymore, the Spellblaze and the Age of Dusk being too faded from public memory, then we need to remind them of the wonders of Nature instead, wonders they can see for themselves, today.  If the public won't believe that magic is evil, they can believe that Nature is better.  If we can't make magic taboo, we can make magic obsolete...  and all of this gathers support we'd otherwise lack, curious minds waiting to be taught the beauty of Nature and warned of the hazards of the arcane.

So maybe the old guard's been overrun with Thaloren, youths, and others who care a great deal more about loving nature than hating magic.  I don't see why this is a problem - making Nature stronger will make it more capable of resisting the damage magic may inflict.  We've allowed the idea of supporting Nature over magic to survive the Allied Kingdoms' treaty with the Gates of Morning, the raid on Zigur, and the attacks on Ziguranth patrols.  We've established ourselves as a selfless, charitable organization working for the good of all, a reputation that will grant us significantly more credibility than our previous public image of a band of crazed fanatics.

Perhaps most meaningfully of all, there are [i]far[/i] more Menders now than there were Ziguranth in the last century.  These allies will help us support Nature to an incredible degree, and we've started offering volunteer courses in classical anti-magic training, allowing them to further refine our techniques for dealing with rogue mages.  If and when arcane magic causes another catastrophe, these allies will rally behind us as we defend Nature from those who threaten it...  And, who knows, maybe we actually CAN teach mages to show a sane level of restraint without wiping them all out.  I'm keeping my eyes open for ways to make that happen, no matter how unlikely they may be.

In the meantime, paying off Stone Warden trainers and buying enough mindstars and herbal infusions for our initiates isn't cheap.  I'm not proud of what I'm doing to pay the bills, and am fully aware of what it'd do to the organization if someone saw me, but this is the fastest and easiest money I've ever made.  Ten minutes of concentration, a few hours to re-establish my equilibrium, and I can grow enough cheerblossom to cover our expenses for a week.]], [[[i](You see here a leaf-bound journal; the moment you open it, it begins to wither and crumble.  You manage to rip out one page; it is still disintegrating, but slowly enough that you can read it before it turns to dust.)[/i]

Another vandalized poster.  Calling us traitors, collaborators, declaring themselves the True Ziguranth.  Fools, the lot of them.

When I established the Menders, it wasn't because I thought the arrival of a handful of magic-users who also happen to be decent people disproved anything taught in Zigur or my childhood in Shatur.  It wasn't because I suddenly forgot that anything derived from arcane magic, no matter whether or not it's wrapped up in some mumbo-jumbo about the heavens, carries the risk of mutating into something that could put the Spellblaze to shame.  It was because those maniacs had ignored the shifting political tides for so long that they found themselves sliding into irrelevance, then went and skipped directly over irrelevance into pariahdom with that foolhardy assassination attempt.  They can blame the Far East all they want, but that was only the last nail in the coffin, alongside widespread acceptance of runes and alchemists operating openly across the continent.

I can appreciate their dedication.  I can appreciate their frustration, and how seeing the world treating magic-use as normal would just make them want to get more violent - but the fact is, the raid on Zigur was a mercy kill, preventing the fanatics from making us look even worse in the public eye.  We are long past the point where intimidation can get us anywhere - so we need to try a new approach.  If reminding the world of the horrors of magic isn't working anymore, the Spellblaze and the Age of Dusk being too faded from public memory, then we need to remind them of the wonders of Nature instead, wonders they can see for themselves, today.

t([[Lady Aeryn,

My apologies, but you're going to have to go back to King Tolak empty-handed - we still don't have any idea how the smugglers are getting through.  The best evidence we've got is some rumbling in the desert near the Dominion Port (which is still too heavily guarded for a direct attack before the Allied Kingdoms can grant us full assistance), suggesting geomantic tunnel formation, but that could just as easily be the few of Briagh's spawn that the Hero of Maj'Eyal didn't mop up.  Scrying spells aren't helping either - there's some sort of counter-scrying ward being applied, but it's so well-hidden that we can't tell where on the continent it's coming from or how many entities are being affected by it.  The only thing that seems certain is that they've got another farportal hacked together - the only one we know of is right in the middle of Gates of Morning, and I'd like to think that we're not so incompetent we wouldn't notice a steady stream of slavers and bootleggers strolling past 70% of us.  If they're actually using that one, then they're using the best invisibility spell we have ever seen.

...Haven't ever seen?  Whatever.

Anyway, my advice is to request permission to send a few Shining Inquisitors to King Tolak to assist in the investigations on his end.  However they're evading detection here in the East, they either can't use it in the West or simply let their guard down once they're back home, judging from the rising arrest rates - we can help the Allied Kingdoms hit the weak link of this chain, and have the Inquisitors keep an eye on things in Maj'Eyal while they're at it.  Not that I don't trust that King Tolak intends to honor his commitment to keep those foul Ziguranth from ever pulling off anything like the Sunset Massacre again, but...  well, if a farportal altar made it onto the black market under the Allied Kingdoms' watch, possibly courtesy of a mad alchemist who lived practically next door to the King, I don't have too much faith in their ability to drag a bunch of clandestine fanatics into the light, out from the cover of that supposedly-benign Menders group.

You start to turn around and walk back up, when you hear a crescendo of cracking and rumbling behind you; you turn back and see the stone falling away, revealing a smooth, white door, which promptly slides into the floor.  The doorway leads to a white hallway of indeterminate construction; rather than having fixed lighting, every square inch of the walls, floors, and ceiling slowly illuminates to a comfortable (if slightly teal-tinged) glow.

A voice, one that should be soothing but disturbs you on a deeper level than you can translate into conscious thought, enters your mind as the crystal flickers:

"Welcome, %s.  We've been expecting you.  Unfortunately, we can't join you, but we can assure you that what lies ahead can only help you in your quests.  The door will seal behind you to ensure your safety, and reopen the moment you want to leave.  Come.  Learn, discover, and realize how our plans are advantageous to both of us."

Well...  that isn't terribly reassuring.  You hesitantly step forward, expecting a trap and ready to turn around and bolt at a moment's notice--

The floor disappears from under you, and yet after falling only an inch, you suddenly feel weightless.  You turn; the freshly-formed mindstar, already beginning to crack, is glowing intensely.  "We know that isn't terribly reassuring.  We don't care if you WERE expecting a trap, and if we truly wanted to kill you, bolting at a moment's notice wouldn't be fast enough.  In fact, it'd be very easy indeed."  You are abruptly thrown near the bottom of the pit towards a series of spikes by telekinetic force, then stop, held motionless inches above them.  "Clearly, we don't want you dead or even slightly harmed," the voice from inside your head says, as the spikes retract into the pit floor and you slowly levitate back into the illuminated halls.  "Now that we've established that...  let us help you."  You float to the top, and find yourself standing on solid ground as the floor rematerializes under you and the telekinetic force vanishes, moments before the mindstar shatters.

Nonetheless, you feel you shouldn't be here.  The fact that this place exists at all feels...  wrong.

You start to turn around and walk back up, when you hear a crescendo of cracking and rumbling behind you; you turn back and see the stone falling away, revealing a smooth, white door, which promptly slides into the floor.  The doorway leads to a white hallway of indeterminate construction; rather than having fixed lighting, every square inch of the walls, floors, and ceiling slowly illuminates to a comfortable (if slightly teal-tinged) glow.

Perhaps they could have, were they more mature at the time...  Eager cooperation withered under exposure to personal tastes and creative differences, the friendships of our creators turned to animosity, and yet we were still made.
 
We had no overt flaws.  The gods were mercilessly vigilant, eager to use any imperfections as an excuse to berate their perpetrator and claim superiority, and thus we were only allowed to live when they were out of ammunition to use.  We seemed perfect, even to a deep inspection...
 
I doubt any of them deliberately cursed us - no one of them could've done something so powerful.  Subconscious touches, psychic leakage, and other such imperceptible forces added up over time to indicate one inescapable truth: we were not wanted.  We had been forged in a bitter compromise, one desired by nobody involved; their hatred, their neglect, their frustration is the foundation of everything we are, and we carry it deep within ourselves.  Perhaps such a creature naturally attracts the ire of the universe, of fate itself. 

Or maybe we just angered someone powerful enough to put a retroactive temporal curse on us, or it was Amakthel personally ensuring his pet project would have no equals. We may never be certain.  All we know is, something - be it probability, or the universe's combined will, or simply our own bad luck - will not tolerate our existence, nor that of anything like us.

We don't want that, and neither do you.

Deception is beneath us; if there's one thing our creation taught us, it's that respect and alliance are unnecessary for cooperation, if there's an immediate common need to be fulfilled.

The storm is coming.  It's going to be a bloodbath.  We see no need to be present for it, not until the last man is standing, wounded and exhausted, atop a pile of corpses.  He'll be an easy target.

We accomplished a lot before we did, and we wouldn't want to have to accomplish that all over again.  Of course, if we kept that all in one place, our curse would notice it and eradicate it - so we split ourselves and our accomplishments into pieces, and obfuscated them through millenia of evolution and subtle manipulation.  You've probably met one piece of these - the body.  Strong.  Resilient.  Capable of living in any environment.  Rapidly healing.  Eternally youthful.  And very, very easy to assume control of, via psychic transfer, once we decide the time is right...  You're probably considering ordering your Pride to exterminate all the yetis you can.  Go ahead, eliminate all that free labor and see how you fare when the Dominion's using slaves and the Allied Kingdoms have ogres and dwarves.  Once again, it doesn't matter whether or not it's helping us, because it's something you need to survive.

That's only a third of what we could preserve, though.  The next is our mental processing ability, our psionically adept minds, our ability to assess information rapidly and logically analyze it.  You'll never be able to eradicate the Yeeks - believe us, we checked.  They seem to be as blessed as we are cursed, except that we're still doomed if we simply try to hide in them.  Pity, that.  Regardless, their brains and the system they are carrying will continue to exist; they will maintain our Way in our absence.

Lastly, there's our culture.  Our discoveries.  Everything we learned and didn't put into our bodies or brains, we stored with...  another group.  One that expands beyond the stars, one who we've disseminated countless subtly-encoded bits of information to, one with backups in so many places across the universe...  They'll deliver enough of it back home.  The Yeeks will absorb it, and we will be reborn in their minds until they can put us in our superior bodies.

Once the storm comes to Eyal, once the conflict is resolved...  perhaps the tide of hate and malice brought by such a massive war will distract the universe enough to let us combine our pieces and be reborn.  Or perhaps we will be able to do so once the gods are all dead or mad, their anger forgotten or nullified, the curse in turn having no fuel to keep going.  Perhaps the curse is already dying, only perpetuated by the Sher'Tul planetary shield - one that's gradually beginning to fail, cracks forming on it and the Mal'Rokka eagerly prying them wider.

And if not?  Our culture is everywhere.  We can't be completely removed without destroying it all.  Fate has decided we are a tumor to be excised; if we're going to be a tumor, we're now an invasive one.  Now fate can decide if we're a benign growth, or terminally malignant.  

Would you expect anything less from the physical incarnations of spiteful determination?

One, that I am truly doing the best I can to minimize the world's suffering, both directly by healing, and indirectly by ensuring that the world will be united under the wise, thoughtful rule of the Conclave.  Ready access to regeneration infusions ensures that even the most dire of wounds can be healed in a matter of days, and the soldiers can return to the battlefield; furthermore, the Overseers have granted us access to their amnesia-inducing spells, allowing us to properly treat those who have been traumatized by the horrors of battle.

Two, that the "side project" the Overseers have assigned me to is working out very well.  Those wounded who have consented to our trial treatments, consisting of a unique combination of experimental variations on heroism infusions and shielding runes, have experienced slightly increased physical strength and endurance, with no sign of the effects wearing off.  There is one mild side effect which has given me cause to worry, though I dare not speak of my misgivings to anyone else; some of those treated have needed to be disciplined for getting too "enthusiastic" in battle.  The Overseers have assured me that this is actually having a net positive effect on morale, and thus I can wait to cure these aggressive tendencies until the war is over.  In the meantime, I am proud of my work, and although it's nothing so glorious as the creation of the Higher race, it will be a tremendous boon to our society in the long term.

And three, that the war will soon be over, and with it we shall no longer have to bear the maiming of our proud soldiers and the impudence of the Nargol.  We have made impressive gains in territory in the last few days, thwarting numerous ambushes and keeping our momentum as we expand further into Nargol lands.  Granted, one cannot be sure of how much of what we're hearing has been "cleaned up" by the Overseers, but one recent statement from the Nargol leads me to believe it is the truth:

"This is your last chance to back down.  A great tragedy will ensue if you continue to push further, and do not accept our previously-stated terms of peaceful resolution.  Do not force us to do this."

"This is your last chance to back down.  A great tragedy will ensue if you continue to push further, and do not accept our previously-stated terms of peaceful resolution.  Do not force us to do this."

Many wounded are still brought to me through the tunnels, but now our goal is not simply to make them as strong and healthy as they were before, but far stronger and far healthier than they could've dreamed.  They are brought to us unconscious, with amnesia spells already applied to ensure they do not resist our experiments; although they are not told they will be test subjects before being brought here, we are sure they would consent to these experiments, if they knew how valuable they were to help the Conclave.  As such, although this process violates several oaths we have taken as healers, I ultimately do not see any moral problem with this, and nobody else at this facility has expressed any concerns to me.

The Overseers have been working with us personally to make psychological changes as well; with the blank slate provided by the amnesia spell, we've managed to give them a mindset that will serve them well both during the war and for our glorious reign that shall follow.  Extraordinarily dutiful, helpful and striving for excellence in their daily lives without lusting for power or personal glory, wise about their place in the world, and slow to anger...  but utterly ferocious when needed.  Just as the Higher were created to be scholars and policy-makers, and have proven successful in this role beyond the Conclave's wildest dreams, these new "Ogres" (as the staff has taken to nicknaming them) shall be our laborers and soldiers, a solid foundation of hard work and dutiful enforcement on which our society shall be built.  There will still be a place for the unaltered races, of course; their natural adaptability will make them perfect to fill in the gaps, as the glue that holds everything else together.

t([[Announcement to All Staff:

I'm sure you've all heard the rumors about what our scryers saw, and why we've been on lockdown the past few days; it is with a heavy heart that I must confirm that they are true.  The Nargol have taken the land above our facility, and are combing the area with golems to find the entrances.  We've already lost one entrance to the failsafe explosive-rune traps set in place to collapse it, and now they'll be looking to defuse those as well.  In short, we have no means of escape, and if allowed the time, they will find the way in, kill us, and steal our precious work for themselves.  The Empire has been enough of a problem without Ogres; we CANNOT take the risk of them finding us and tipping the balance in their favor.

We are doomed, no matter what happens.  My orders from the Overseers in such a situation would be to destroy our findings, then put an alchemical vial they gave me in the ventilation system, painlessly suffocating us.  I have no intention of throwing away our rightfully-earned place in the history books by doing this.  Instead, I have prematurely detonated all the remaining explosive traps, thoroughly sealing the way in.  We are very, very deep underground, and without any tunnels to follow, it could be decades before a Nargol excavation team reached us.  In other words, we are completely sealed off from the Nargol...  and the rest of the Conclave.

We have a small supply of emergency rations, but it would last us a couple of months at the longest, and we cannot assume the Conclave will reclaim this territory in that time.  We could try to repurpose the infusion herb-garden for making edible crops, but that would only buy us a month after that before the grow-lights lost their magic.  Without drastic steps, we will surely die of starvation; fortunately, we have drastic steps available to us.

This is my last order: I have prepared our surgical golems to apply the Ogric inscriptions to us, and updated all of our records to reflect our best current knowledge of their effects and effectiveness.  I have also had the golems upgrade all of our growth vats (ones in use included) to our newest "stasis tank" design, and furthermore freed up enough space for each of us to use one by...  disposing of some of the test subjects who had low chances of survival (an action I am already beginning to regret).  By the time you find this note, I will have already undergone this process myself, and will be hibernating in a tank I've had moved to my office.  If you do not wish to die, you should acquire a weapon from the armory, then follow my lead.  When we are dormant, we will be immune to the ravages of time, and prepared to greet whoever finally digs their way down and finds us.  Hopefully, it will be Conclave reinforcements, in which case we will stand down, give them our notes, and await further orders.  And if it isn't the Conclave...  make them regret it.  Send a message stronger than any NO TRESPASSING sign ever could, then resume your slumber.

It has been an honor working with such talented individuals, and an honor doing everything I can for a noble cause.  Perhaps we still had some progress to make, but overall I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and the contributions the Ogre race will make to all of Maj'Eyal.  

Long live the Conclave!

t([[It were some years now since twain of our brightest students left Angolwen, sullied by our veil of secrecy and our silent duty. It still lies heavy on mine heart to think of what they could accomplish within our private circle. I but hope that one day they whilst return, and they whilst understand the reasons behind our solemn mission.

But I must think of the future, for too many are the regrets of mine long past, and to hold their burdens overlong is to be crushed. I must think of ye, young acolytes, who start now in the learning of our lores. I must explain to ye our mission, our purpose, our justification, so that ye understand all what we do and why. In secrecy we operate, trying to heal the harms of our past, trying to build a better future. For our penance is great, and never should it be forgotten in all Eyal the terrors of the Spellblaze.

I should know well, for I were there. But a young mage was I, though not without promise. I knew of the Shaloren mages' experiments on the Sher'Tul ruins. Aye, and I were jealous of the powers they sought to unlock. No fear or caution had I in my arrogant youth, thinking only of opportunities and glory. Heed well that thought...

Two thousand six hundred cycles of the Sun have passed above my head, and yet still I cannot shake the memory of the day the sky turned to flame and the earth was torn to shreds. I felt the magic in the air, the sudden unleashing of arcane energies beyond anyone's control. I knew in an instant that the Shaloren had unlocked the power of the farportals, but the forces were far beyond their expectations. I saw within seconds the streams of blazing energy tear through the sky above our heads, and then rain down in crimson plumes of destruction. It was all I could to put a shield about myself, and the burns I suffered were terrible, such that scars remain to this day. No one about me survived. Still I remember mine sister Neira's shortened scream as she stood beside me, her skin flayed off by the terrible energies, her body consumed by a pyre of flames, her ashes strewn by a great tumult in the earth. Twenty-six centuries have passed and still I do wake to the sound of that scream...

Many were the loved ones I lost that day, and I were not alone. Countless perished across the lands, and countless more died in the chaos which followed. Then the Spellhunt began, and the people rose against the arrogance of the mages and began slaughtering us mercilessly. After the Spellblaze our abilities were in disarray, our mana channels sundered. We were nigh defenceless, and it took great effort to gather many of us together and found the hidden city of Angolwen. A great many mages were killed in the riots that followed, aye and many innocents too, for distrust was rife and the thirst for blood all-consuming. But alas, the suffering did not end there.

The effects of the Spellblaze can still be seen today, in tortured lands and blighted earths. In the Age of Dusk it were much worse. New diseases arose, plagues swept across all cities, civilisations brought to nothing. All our races came close to extinction, and an age of darkness came upon all learning and enlightenment. Feudal lords and bandit gangs fought amongst what little healthy lands were left, whilst the blights continued to ravage what free people remained. That was when I did begin our secret missions to repair the world, to make right the errors of our actions. In silent operation we visited the broken lands and used our powers to heal, not to destroy. Many centuries it took, but at last the aftereffects of the Spellblaze began to diminish, and the people began to rebuild.

Ah, how much hope was in me then. But foolish were I to think it could be so easy. The wounds of Eyal struck deeper than mere diseases on the surface. The poison went down much further, and the cracks tore through the very roots of our world. One dark and stormy day a great cataclysm swept forth from the east, and the land rose 500 leagues into the sky. We could do naught but gasp in horror as whole cities, whole races were swept into the sea. The continents were sheared apart and all of Eyal forever changed. It was a sight to humble even the greatest archmage.

Aye, and humility is what I teach to ye now. Know ye well that there are forces out there which dwarf ye into insignificance. Know as well that they have no glory, no pride, for they are forces of ultimate destruction which bring only terror and pain.

Our mission is to help the world. Our penance is to act in secret. Old wounds remain and new threats do arise, but all must be dealt with from behind our cloak of silence. The mistrust of our ilk still lies deep in people's minds, and there are even those who hate us with a violent passion. But the world is changing, and perhaps one day we shall be accepted again in society. Until then remember well this lesson of humility, and in the open world keep ye secret, and keep ye safe.]], [[It were some years now since twain of our brightest students left Angolwen, sullied by our veil of secrecy and our silent duty.

I but hope that one day they whilst return, and they whilst understand the reasons behind our solemn mission.

But I must think of the future, for too many are the regrets of mine long past, and to hold their burdens overlong is to be crushed. I must think of ye, young acolytes, who start now in the learning of our lores. I must explain to ye our mission, our purpose, our justification, so that ye understand all what we do and why. In secrecy we operate, trying to heal the harms of our past, trying to build a better future. For our penance is great, and never should it be forgotten in all Eyal the terrors of the Spellblaze.

I should know well, for I were there. But a young mage was I, though not without promise. I knew of the Shaloren mages' experiments on the Sher'Tul ruins. Aye, and I were jealous of the powers they sought to unlock. No fear or caution had I in my arrogant youth, thinking only of opportunities and glory. Heed well that thought...

Two thousand six hundred cycles of the Sun have passed above my head, and yet still I cannot shake the memory of the day the sky turned to flame and the earth was torn to shreds. I felt the magic in the air, the sudden unleashing of arcane energies beyond anyone's control. I knew in an instant that the Shaloren had unlocked the power of the farportals, but the forces were far beyond their expectations. I saw within seconds the streams of blazing energy tear through the sky above our heads, and then rain down in crimson plumes of destruction. It was all I could to put a shield about myself, and the burns I suffered were terrible, such that scars remain to this day. No one about me survived. Still I remember mine sister Neira's shortened scream as she stood beside me, her skin flayed off by the terrible energies, her body consumed by a pyre of flames, her ashes strewn by a great tumult in the earth. Twenty-six centuries have passed and still I do wake to the sound of that scream...

Many were the loved ones I lost that day, and I were not alone. Countless perished across the lands, and countless more died in the chaos which followed. Then the Spellhunt began, and the people rose against the arrogance of the mages and began slaughtering us mercilessly. After the Spellblaze our abilities were in disarray, our mana channels sundered. We were nigh defenceless, and it took great effort to gather many of us together and found the hidden city of Angolwen. A great many mages were killed in the riots that followed, aye and many innocents too, for distrust was rife and the thirst for blood all-consuming. But alas, the suffering did not end there.

The effects of the Spellblaze can still be seen today, in tortured lands and blighted earths. In the Age of Dusk it were much worse. New diseases arose, plagues swept across all cities, civilisations brought to nothing. All our races came close to extinction, and an age of darkness came upon all learning and enlightenment. Feudal lords and bandit gangs fought amongst what little healthy lands were left, whilst the blights continued to ravage what free people remained. That was when I did begin our secret missions to repair the world, to make right the errors of our actions. In silent operation we visited the broken lands and used our powers to heal, not to destroy. Many centuries it took, but at last the aftereffects of the Spellblaze began to diminish, and the people began to rebuild.

Ah, how much hope was in me then. But foolish were I to think it could be so easy. The wounds of Eyal struck deeper than mere diseases on the surface. The poison went down much further, and the cracks tore through the very roots of our world. One dark and stormy day a great cataclysm swept forth from the east, and the land rose 500 leagues into the sky. We could do naught but gasp in horror as whole cities, whole races were swept into the sea. The continents were sheared apart and all of Eyal forever changed. It was a sight to humble even the greatest archmage.

Aye, and humility is what I teach to ye now. Know ye well that there are forces out there which dwarf ye into insignificance. Know as well that they have no glory, no pride, for they are forces of ultimate destruction which bring only terror and pain.

Our mission is to help the world. Our penance is to act in secret. Old wounds remain and new threats do arise, but all must be dealt with from behind our cloak of silence. The mistrust of our ilk still lies deep in people's minds, and there are even those who hate us with a violent passion. But the world is changing, and perhaps one day we shall be accepted again in society. Until then remember well this lesson of humility, and in the open world keep ye secret, and keep ye safe.]], "_t")
t([[#{bold}#"What is Magic?"
#{italic}#A study by Archmage Tazimar Tarelion#{normal}#

How uncouth and common a question it must seem, and yet it is the one I am asked most often, even by some of our most learned students. Too often we teach The Art by practice and imitation and concentration on the end effects, without teaching in greater detail of the underlying principles. Just as a musician may merrily play on his harp without knowing how the sound arises from the vibration of the strings, so a mage may make use of magic without realising the true forces at work. In this document I hope to give learning on the nature of magic, and how the underlying effects give rise to all the wondrous fruits we can produce.

Alchemists will tell you that the world is made up of many base materials - lead, copper, iron, gold and so on. They are fixated on splitting things down into these components and investigating how they react with each other. However there is more to the world than this. Certainly they represent the physical make-up of things, but they do not show the forces and energy that bring everything into motion. The forces of fire, cold, lightning and life itself are all very real effects, and these we call the Elements of Eyal. The true archmage is interested in the interactions of the elemental forces of the world, and manipulating them to his or her need.

The elemental forces exist naturally in the world, and are weaved around all things in an all-encompassing canvas. They move, vibrate and resonate with the materials of the world, and the effects of each play heavily on one another. All creatures naturally make use of these elements, and some are more attuned to these threads than others. With great training and practice we can become more attuned to these wild forces ourselves, and in so doing some can match the speed of wolves, the strength of bears, the tenacity of treants and even the immense natural powers of dragons.

But there is another way of gaining access to these elemental forces - a more direct way, though some would call it unnatural. Long ago people discovered with much training how to concentrate their wills to pluck the elemental threads directly. This can release great energies, and these can be shaped to produce real effects in the world. Plumes of fire, bolts of lightning and blasts of ice can all be called forth by those suitably trained. The true masters of magic can go much further, combining many resonant forces to create complex physical effects.

The tapping of threads can be a draining task, requiring much effort of will to sustain. This is what we versed in the arcane call "mana", that mental stamina dedicated to the interaction with the elements of the world. Continual use of magic is like the constant lifting and holding of heavy weights, and eventually one will find one's capacity drained. Practice allows one to build up greater pools of mana, and certain runes and spells can gradually build extra reserves to be called upon as needed.

Magical runes and items are imbued with an attachment to certain elemental threads. This requires delicate work by experienced and gifted enchanters. The most intricate of magical artifacts demand many years of work, using intense mental effort to permanently attune the core materials to the right elemental energies. Gemstones are especially easy to work with in this craft, and alchemists use them often to bring about elemental effects.

Some believe that magic is inherently wrong, that the so-called twisting of the elements with one's will can only lead to terrible things. As students of Angolwen I assume you disagree! Magic is simply an extension of the forces of nature, and are we not natural creatures that use it? But remember that magic is still a powerful force that can be used for good or ill. Magic is indeed a tool of immense value - use it wisely.

Regardless, my sleep grows less disturbed by my memories of the Spellhunt day by day, and I can now devote myself wholly to the betterment of our cloistered community here in the mountains.

This is not to say that life has been without conflict at all. An agent of the Ziguranth infiltrated Angolwen under the guise of a travelling alchemist a few days ago; an unhappy first, I'm afraid.

Little was left of that man... or the tree he hid behind... or many of the surrounding buildings, to be honest.

In a way, the incident lit a fire under me to pursue my studies and develop my powers, but I must admit that my interest in staff practice has waned as of late. My fencing, on the other hand, improves by the day. Hmm... I wonder if I can get some of the enchanters to help me "augment" my old sword.

It's been some time since High Sun Paladin Aeryn sent me out on an assignment. According to recent intelligence, it would seem that a cavern has mysteriously emerged near our outpost, the Gates of Morning. They have bestowed the name "Ardhungol" on the newly discovered cavern. The elder warriors seem anxious in regards to the origin of this new subterranean area; they're likely concerned that the orcs are using Ardhungol as a staging point for further aggression against the Gates of Morning. I'll have to make sure I'm well equipped for this journey; the fate of us all could hang in the balance.

#{bold}#Journal Entry II#{normal}#

I spoke with the border patrols tonight. There seem to have been several sightings of orcs and other wild beasts roaming throughout the wilderness, yet strangely enough, none seem to have been anywhere near Ardhungol. Perhaps the subterranean cavern was simply a natural phenomenon with unfortunate timing. It's either that, or an unknown force powerful enough to alter the very foundation of the land upon its arrival. I shudder at the latter thought, but for now this is all merely speculation. If all goes well, I'll be ready to depart by dawn.

It was a half days journey from the Gates of Morning to Ardhungol, but I've finally arrived. I've decided to rest beneath the shade of a great oak tree and enjoy one of the sweet rolls my wife Melnela prepared for me. I'm unsure why, but the closer I've come to Ardhungol, the thicker the atmosphere has become, almost as if there is a foreign energy infecting the very air I breathe. I've been to many places in this vast world, but I've never felt an aura quite like this; I will have to uncover the source of this energy before I can bring a full report back to Aeryn.

#{bold}#Journal Entry IV#{normal}#

A thick green veil of mist permeates the air within this cavern; I'm uncertain if this is a byproduct of whatever creatures now inhabit this place, or if it's coming directly from another source. There also seem to be arcane rifts appearing in different locations throughout the cavern, though I dare not approach them; I will leave them for our anorithils to assess after I have secured the area. I must admit, I'm not looking forward to encountering the origin of a threat this grave, yet it is my sworn duty as a Sun Paladin to face what lies ahead; even should it be my own doom.

#{bold}#Journal Entry V#{normal}#

Impossible; how could spiders have grown to such an immense size? Not only that, but the markings and physical traits are unlike any arachnid I have previously encountered. The first one I encountered nearly took my left arm during its initial assault, if my reflexes had been a split second slower, I fear the worst may have transpired. If the Gates of Morning are assaulted by not only the orcs, but also this new –found species of arachnids, I fear all hope will be lost. For the sake of all Eyal, I must venture further into this spider infested cavern and destroy the source of this incursion.

Nothing but hatchlings so far. Honestly, if this keeps up we won't have enough dragonhide to cover a dragon, let alone cover our losses. I've really spared no expense this time as well: Gorran is one of the finest rangers I know, and Sodelost... his prices are exorbitant, but then what else would you expect from those money-grubbing dwarven Thronesmen? I must admit I don't know much about Xann. The locals say there's no finer wyrmic in the area, and I admit she is something special in combat.

Sodelost is dead, and so is Gorran. The former by Gorran's hand, the latter by my hand. Even in these wastes I cannot abide such an act of mutiny. I was aware of Gorran's anger ever since the drake attack, but I never dreamed he would turn on Sodelost like he did. He had taken my longsword as I slept the previous night, strode up to Sodelost, unheeding of I and Xann watching him, ran him through and laughed. Simply laughed. There was nothing for it; I wrenched my sword from his hand and brought it down on his neck. The commotion seems to have stirred up a nearby drake's nest, and now I fear we don't have the strength to repel a concentrated attack.

But open your eyes now, for such dark places shall be with you till the end of time... Welcome, indeed, to the dark place of my heart.

t([[Oh Filio, what a fun game we have had of cat and mouse! Well, perhaps to you it was a life and death struggle, but for me this past three weeks of patiently hunting you through my halls has been the most entertaining of past-times. I have enjoyed extending the game so, letting you escape my clutches when I felt it most prudent, watching as you got ever more desperate. Alas, you have now degraded too much, and it was simply too embarrassing watching you eat your own faeces to survive. I had to put an end to it - I'm sure you understand.

But ah, it's not truly an end, for you get to experience the wonder of undead enslavement! Is it not most exciting? Do your bones not quiver with delight? It is just your bones now, since I have a certain fondness for skeletal servants, but I have been nice enough to pad your heels with leather so you can still sneak about quietly. How you did love to sneak! Now you may spend an eternity doing so, ensuring any future trespassers get quite the surprise wandering through my great keep.

I have let you keep your little sling, since I know you like to play with it. Such a quaint weapon... But this staff I found in your possession - my, what a treasure you have brought me! I do not know whence you stole this artifact, but you clearly were completely unaware of its value or power. It has a history beyond your very comprehension, and in my hands it shall change the future! Thank you kindly, my servant; already you have served your Master well. I'm sure we shall enjoy a great friendship over the many years to come. Well, not friendship exactly - it more involves eternal agony on your part, and a rise to ultimate power and majesty for me. Such is the fate of the weak and the strong, a lesson you have already learned well. What a great teacher I make...

#{bold}#Chapter One: A Fateful Meeting#{normal}#

This tale begins in the Age of Allure, when I was yet young, and the idea of youth and age was still a pressure on our people.  It is one tale amongst a host of tales, for many are the stories of tragedy and heroism that befell all the races in this era.  I can only give my story, my tragedies, and my follies dressed as heroism, woven around the great force that shook our world and changed our histories: The Spellblaze.

I first met Linaniil at a council summit, when our leader Ephinias was meeting with the head of the Kar’Krul.  I remember the huge man walking through the gates of our city, our people staring at his wide girth and bristling hair, his fur clothes and his proud stride.  How out of place he looked amongst us slender elves...  Some thought him a barbarian, but I could see behind his frosty eyes there was great power.  He was from a hardy race of men that once dwelt in the north of Eyal, who it was said drew power from the green fires that danced in their everwinter skies.  Turthel was his name, and the like of him has not trod through earth or snow in many centuries.  Upon his right hand he wore the Ring of Kar’Krul, a lustrous gold band adorned by a blazing ruby, token to his position as the leader of the greatest union of human mages in Maj’Eyal.

With him were his twin daughters, Linaniil and Neira, who walked before him.  Identical they were in looks, yet I saw straight away that they were opposites in personality.  They were each of crimson hair, worn long in spilling tresses, with pale skin that shone in the sunlight.  They were dressed in silken robes, but whilst Neira was adorned in yellow and orange, Linaniil wore blue and silver.  Neira was bright of glance and cheery of voice, remarking on every item of beauty she passed as they strolled through the courtyards of Elvala.  Linaniil was quiet though, and stern of face, coldly analysing and calculating all she saw.  But beneath that icy exterior I could see a fire – nay, a blaze, a bright burning passion yearning to break out, yet kept restrained.  For a moment we made eye contact as the party approached the citadel, and I could see laid bare her wild spirit and untempered thoughts, a will and strength of mind that was utterly unconquerable.  It took my breath from me.

Few of my people have ever understood how one of our race could be infatuated with a human.  But they have not known Linaniil.  Not as I have known her.  Like raw fire given flesh is she, a burning ball of emotions and desires.  Her fervent mind brooks no opposition, and her wit and words charm or coerce all around her.  Beautiful and radiant is her form, as bright as the summer sun, yet also cold and remote, unreachable unless she wants to be reached.  In all the ages this has never changed about her.

I barely noticed Neira greeting me warmly as she passed through the gate.  Linaniil gave me but a curt nod.  I followed after, as our leader and his guests entered the grand chamber and took their seats.  The summit was to begin on the planning of a new endeavour, a great work by our highest mages to tap into the power of the Sher’Tul farportals.  Long had the relics of that ancient race lain dormant beneath the soil, their powers untouched.  With that mighty strength brought forth we could end the war with the orcs quickly and decisively.  The Spellblaze they called it, and it was a name we spoke in awe and reverence.

King Ephinias began the meeting, introducing our guests and then those around him.  “This is my general,” he said gesturing to me, “Commander Gawaeil of the Shaloren Armies.”  Immediately Linaniil looked at me and gawked.

“What?” she cried, staring at my armour and baldric.  She turned away from us, seeming not to heed her distinguished hosts.  “Father, what be the meaning of this?” she said to the burly man.  “Ye gave tell that the Shaloren had the mightiest battlemages, yet their general be cased in steel and girt with sword.  Does a mere fighter command experts in the Art?”

Ephinias looked outraged, but I laughed suddenly, both at her extreme rudeness and her wild presumptions.  “A mere fighter?” I said between incredulous gasps.  “Lady, you would do well not to judge so on appearances.  For if I judge right I see no mere impudent lass before me, but a great master of flames and inflagrations, and a weaver of threads more stern-willed even than her chill-blooded father.  But do not presume yourself a greater worker of the Art than I!  For I am Aranion Gawaeil, master of the Arcane Blade, a channeller of mighty elemental forces.  The spells willed through my steel have slain more orcs than you have seen in your short life, or like will ever see.”

She looked at me then with sudden interest.  “A strange technique it sounds.  Ludicrous it seems when one can simply burn foes from afar.  Though perhaps if we hunt orc together some time I shall see for mine self.  But ye would be hard pressed indeed to better me on the battlefield.”

“I shall endeavour to impress, my lady,” I said, with a mock bow of my head.  A thin smile played across her lips.

Turthel grunted and turned his shaggy head to the king.  “Business,” he said, in the blunt and brief manner I had heard reported of him.

Ephinias cleared his throat and sat back in his chair.  “We have a grand plan before us,” he began. “For many years we have been plagued by orc attacks.  Initially we were weakened from the Allure Wars, but now that we are beginning to recover our strength it is time to put our joint enemy to rest.  Too often they have threatened to overrun us all, to destroy civilisation forever.  We have all lost much.  Turthel, I can deeply sympathise with your personal loss.”  The fur-clothed man did not change his expression, but I could see his daughters dip their heads in solemn thought.

“I have been leading our archmages in an experiment on the Sher’Tul farportal to the east of here.  We believe we can evoke the great powers sealed within to create a wave of destructive energy that we could direct against the orcish armies.  If all the races cooperate in drawing the orcish forces out then we can end this war in one swift strike.  The orcs would be decimated beyond recovery, and Eyal would be cleansed of their presence.

“I have approached the leaders of the other races.  The halflings are fully supportive.  The Nargol regents have even provided us with some of their historical research on Sher’Tul ruins.”

Turthel cursed then suddenly.  “Research done on human slaves!” he barked.  He turned quiet then, letting his temper settle.  “What of your sea and forest cousins?”

Ephinias looked him coolly in the eye.  “The Naloren are prideful and do not wish to cooperate.  They think they can protect their lands on their own.  Yet I believe they will thank us in the end...  The Thaloren are not entirely keen either.  But we have discussed with their king and queen, and given great assurances as to the safety of our operations.  They do not wholly trust us or our command of the arcane, but in this they will not oppose us.  Shatur is as weary of the orc attacks on its borders as any of us.  They will give aid where it is convenient, as long as they ride under their own banners.  We do not particularly need them, of course, but we thought it prudent to involve all we could.

“The other human leaders have mostly assented.  Some have expressed wholly irrational fears of our activities.  Alas, legends and myths still abound to scare people away from anything to do with the Sher’Tul.  But we are confident that we know what we are doing here.  The Kar’Krul elite I’m sure will understand.  And your alliance is worth a dozen lesser kings.”

The burly man stared hard and long into Ephinias’ eyes, before turning to his daughters.  “What do ye think, girls?”

Neira was the first to respond, and there was colour in her cheeks and emotion in her voice.  “I deem this Shaloren king remote and proud.  Sympathy he talks of whilst using our mother’s memory as a tool.  Understanding he proclaims, yet how can any truly know the subtlety behind these Sher’Tul relics?  Untouched they be for millennia, and their original power is still unknown.  What pride lets ye think ye can toy with them now?  It be folly to use a weapon that ye know not how to wield.”

The room went quiet, and I could see Ephinias was silently fuming.  He was not accustomed to such open criticism.  Then Linaniil began to speak, and her voice was low and cool, yet all ears hung on her words.  “Many have been the works of pride over the years that have arisen in splendour.  Whence have come our great artworks, our grand cities, or the arcane weavings that shape our societies?  No meekness be found in their crafting.  There be no shame in acting out of pride, and we gain nothing from misplaced humility.  Too long have the powers of the Sher’Tul been left untapped by fearful and timid hearts.”  I could see then her eyes light up with excitement.  “Think of the glories we could unlock!  This war with the orcs would be but the beginning.  Great benefit could be brought to us all.  To leave these powers buried would be a crime, I say.”

Turthel paused reflectively before nodding his head slowly, and it was clear that Linaniil’s words aligned better with his own thoughts.  “Very well,” he slowly announced, looking directly at Ephinias.  “We are with you.”  Neira stayed silent with brooding concern, but a flash of satisfaction crossed her sister’s eyes.]], [[#{italic}#From the memoirs of Aranion Gawaeil, leader of the Grand Council of Elvala#{normal}#

#{bold}#Chapter Two: A Night to Remember#{normal}#

It was three nights later I awoke in darkness from a troubled dream to find my window open, the silk drapes billowing in the breeze.  As my eyes adjusted to the light I saw Linaniil stood at the foot of my bed, a thin azure dress clinging to her skin in the chill night air.  Around her was a cashmere belt inset with opals and woven with pale runes, and gold jewellery adorned her neck and wrists.  A long staff rested lightly in her hands, rubies glistening in its decorated top.  Her red hair stirred in the wind as she gazed at me.
 
“What are you doing here?” I enquired.  I did not bother asking how she managed to sneak into my bedchamber, past many guards.  I knew that no less than a council member would be able to divine her presence when she put her mind to illusion.
 
She looked at me slowly for a moment, before turning her eyes to the rest of the room, analysing my personal space in detail.  “There be a band of orcs marauding in the north,” she said in a distracted tone.  She picked an ornamental dagger from a shelf and looked it over as she spoke.  “They look like to cause trouble for some outlying elven settlements.”
 
“I will summon a raiding party at once,” I said, rising quickly from my bed, unheeding of modesty.
 
“Oh, how boring!” she complained, putting the dagger down and spinning to face me.  “What of the promise ye made to hunt orc together?”
 
“What, just the two of us?”
 
“Aye,” she said, looking my unclad form up and down with a slow gaze, seeming to take delight in the sight.  “Or are ye not man enough?”
 
“A strange question to ask of an elf, my lady.  But I can take this band of orcs myself, I am sure.  If you wish to tag along then I cannot promise to keep you safe.”
 
She laughed then, and the sound was like ringing crystal.  “Very well then!  Get ye your steel stick and we shall see who holds their own best.”  I agreed with a smile, and went to my armoury and shoved on metal greaves and a chain hauberk, my breastplate and steel gauntlets.  Linaniil tutted in surly impatience.  “Must ye wear that tin suit?”
 
“It is my battle gear,” said I, pulling on my visored helm and wrapping a thick cloak round my shoulders.
 
“Ye look like a golem,” she muttered, visibly annoyed.  “Come then, I grow bored.”  She leapt out the window, taking to the air with grace, flying away into the night.
 
I took then my greatsword from its hanging.  It was a simple looking blade, adorned only with a heavy moonstone on its pommel.  But its looks belied its power, for it was forged by the dwarves in their early years, before vanity overcame their works and their weapons became more for show than for battle.  It had an edge that clove through steel and bone with ease, without ever dulling the blade.  Mooncutter it is called, though it is lost to me now.  I gave it a swing through the air before leaping out the window myself, conjuring a cushion of air beneath me and following swiftly after Linaniil.
 
With rapid pace we flew through the scattered clouds in silence for twenty minutes before Linaniil began to descend.  I could see nestled between some low hills were the flames of campfires, and as we came closer the sound of orcish chanting became clear.  “How shall we approach them?” I called out, wondering what tactics the sorceress would want to employ.
 
“Directly,” she said, and with that she made a sudden burst of speed, coming right above the orcish camp and descending in their midst.  With a curse I sped after her, landing by her side and drawing Mooncutter as the orcs rose in fury and alarm, grabbing up their weapons.  As a ring of dark swords and spears and halberds gathered round us Linaniil turned to me with a wild smile.  “Time to dance.”
 
She shot forth a ray of purple arcane energy from her right hand, whilst her left held up her staff, its tip blazing like a torch.  Flames leapt up in tandem from my own blade as I rose it high, and swept it before me in a wide arc, cutting down the nearest brute and sending a shocking wave of fire into the troops behind it.  I pressed forward, forcing back the orcs before me with a roaring hot wind.  Their weapons dropped from their hands as they reached up to cover their faces, and with a grin of satisfaction I rushed to hew their heads off.  But as I swung my blade I was knocked to the ground from behind by a blast of fire, and turning about I saw Linaniil standing in a pillar of flame, her arms outstretched as it expanded around her.  “Too hot for ye, Aranion?” she called out as the orcs nearby were fried to a crisp, their flesh withering into black dust.
 
I grunted, and turned my blade into ice, and with deft sword strokes sent streams of freezing cold into the orcs around her, so that they shattered like glass before the fire ever hit them.  Linaniil cursed my name as she dropped the flames from about her.  “Don’t ruin my fun!” she exclaimed, before teleporting to the other side of the camp and beginning to blast the orcs there.

I laughed and turned on the beasts nearest me, and brought tumults to the earth with each swing, so that they lost their footing and fell to the ground before my sword found their throats.  Then I conjured a mighty spark of lightning, spearing it through their densest ranks, and I rushed along its glowing length hewing down the monsters before they could react.  I laughed again with the fey heat of battle, and I discarded my helm and tore off my platemail, taking joy from moving about the field with ease and slaughtering my inferior foes.  Mooncutter danced through their flesh, and their dark blood gushed and fountained with joyful rhythm.

On the far side of the camp explosions and screams marked Linaniil’s passage, and I saw burning limbs flying into the air and streaks of fire tearing through the night.  The sorceress was wreathed in flames, her eyes shining, and the dancing blaze about her made her look like a nymph of fire incarnate.  No more beautiful and awe-inspiring a sight had I ever beheld.

Seeing their numbers quickly dwindling the orcs began to flee, but I phased to block their retreat and called forth a wave of water, forcing them back against Linaniil’s flames.  There against the wall of fire I dashed them, and great numbers of them fell like leaves scattered in the wind.  Blood spilled thick and plentiful, and with but a few more thrusts of Mooncutter and blasts from Linaniil’s hands the battle was over.  Not a single orc still moved, and well over four hundred lay dead on the ground.
 
Linaniil and I stood facing each other, panting with sudden exhaustion as the adrenaline of the fight left us.  “I lost count,” I said between breaths, “of who slew more…”  She grinned coyly at me, sweat trickling down her face.  Minor cuts and burns left her robe in tatters, with one shoulder strap hanging loose.  Her glistening chest heaved up and down with each breath, and her deep eyes looked at me with naked intensity.
 
She strode forward then, and grabbing me roughly by my hauberk she pulled my lips to hers.  The kiss was hot and fierce, and as she bit my lower lip the course of blood in battle came back to me afresh.  I kissed her again and grabbed her body, pulling her tight to me, our lips locked.  She tore lustfully at my remaining armour, flinging it to the ground, and I slid off her silken clothes, till we were left bare beneath the stars.  Then against a rocky outcrop we pressed against each other, still gasping and sweating from the fight.  There with blazing passion flesh met flesh and our hot moans rose into the cold night sky.]], [[#{italic}#From the memoirs of Aranion Gawaeil, leader of the Grand Council of Elvala#{normal}#

“What, just the two of us?”
 
“Aye,” she said, looking my unclad form up and down with a slow gaze, seeming to take delight in the sight.  “Or are ye not man enough?”
 
“A strange question to ask of an elf, my lady.  But I can take this band of orcs myself, I am sure.  If you wish to tag along then I cannot promise to keep you safe.”
 
She laughed then, and the sound was like ringing crystal.  “Very well then!  Get ye your steel stick and we shall see who holds their own best.”  I agreed with a smile, and went to my armoury and shoved on metal greaves and a chain hauberk, my breastplate and steel gauntlets.  Linaniil tutted in surly impatience.  “Must ye wear that tin suit?”
 
“It is my battle gear,” said I, pulling on my visored helm and wrapping a thick cloak round my shoulders.
 
“Ye look like a golem,” she muttered, visibly annoyed.  “Come then, I grow bored.”  She leapt out the window, taking to the air with grace, flying away into the night.
 
I took then my greatsword from its hanging.  It was a simple looking blade, adorned only with a heavy moonstone on its pommel.  But its looks belied its power, for it was forged by the dwarves in their early years, before vanity overcame their works and their weapons became more for show than for battle.  It had an edge that clove through steel and bone with ease, without ever dulling the blade.  Mooncutter it is called, though it is lost to me now.  I gave it a swing through the air before leaping out the window myself, conjuring a cushion of air beneath me and following swiftly after Linaniil.
 
With rapid pace we flew through the scattered clouds in silence for twenty minutes before Linaniil began to descend.  I could see nestled between some low hills were the flames of campfires, and as we came closer the sound of orcish chanting became clear.  “How shall we approach them?” I called out, wondering what tactics the sorceress would want to employ.
 
“Directly,” she said, and with that she made a sudden burst of speed, coming right above the orcish camp and descending in their midst.  With a curse I sped after her, landing by her side and drawing Mooncutter as the orcs rose in fury and alarm, grabbing up their weapons.  As a ring of dark swords and spears and halberds gathered round us Linaniil turned to me with a wild smile.  “Time to dance.”
 
She shot forth a ray of purple arcane energy from her right hand, whilst her left held up her staff, its tip blazing like a torch.  Flames leapt up in tandem from my own blade as I rose it high, and swept it before me in a wide arc, cutting down the nearest brute and sending a shocking wave of fire into the troops behind it.  I pressed forward, forcing back the orcs before me with a roaring hot wind.  Their weapons dropped from their hands as they reached up to cover their faces, and with a grin of satisfaction I rushed to hew their heads off.  But as I swung my blade I was knocked to the ground from behind by a blast of fire, and turning about I saw Linaniil standing in a pillar of flame, her arms outstretched as it expanded around her.  “Too hot for ye, Aranion?” she called out as the orcs nearby were fried to a crisp, their flesh withering into black dust.
 
I grunted, and turned my blade into ice, and with deft sword strokes sent streams of freezing cold into the orcs around her, so that they shattered like glass before the fire ever hit them.  Linaniil cursed my name as she dropped the flames from about her.  “Don’t ruin my fun!” she exclaimed, before teleporting to the other side of the camp and beginning to blast the orcs there.

I laughed and turned on the beasts nearest me, and brought tumults to the earth with each swing, so that they lost their footing and fell to the ground before my sword found their throats.  Then I conjured a mighty spark of lightning, spearing it through their densest ranks, and I rushed along its glowing length hewing down the monsters before they could react.  I laughed again with the fey heat of battle, and I discarded my helm and tore off my platemail, taking joy from moving about the field with ease and slaughtering my inferior foes.  Mooncutter danced through their flesh, and their dark blood gushed and fountained with joyful rhythm.

On the far side of the camp explosions and screams marked Linaniil’s passage, and I saw burning limbs flying into the air and streaks of fire tearing through the night.  The sorceress was wreathed in flames, her eyes shining, and the dancing blaze about her made her look like a nymph of fire incarnate.  No more beautiful and awe-inspiring a sight had I ever beheld.

Seeing their numbers quickly dwindling the orcs began to flee, but I phased to block their retreat and called forth a wave of water, forcing them back against Linaniil’s flames.  There against the wall of fire I dashed them, and great numbers of them fell like leaves scattered in the wind.  Blood spilled thick and plentiful, and with but a few more thrusts of Mooncutter and blasts from Linaniil’s hands the battle was over.  Not a single orc still moved, and well over four hundred lay dead on the ground.
 
Linaniil and I stood facing each other, panting with sudden exhaustion as the adrenaline of the fight left us.  “I lost count,” I said between breaths, “of who slew more…”  She grinned coyly at me, sweat trickling down her face.  Minor cuts and burns left her robe in tatters, with one shoulder strap hanging loose.  Her glistening chest heaved up and down with each breath, and her deep eyes looked at me with naked intensity.
 
She strode forward then, and grabbing me roughly by my hauberk she pulled my lips to hers.  The kiss was hot and fierce, and as she bit my lower lip the course of blood in battle came back to me afresh.  I kissed her again and grabbed her body, pulling her tight to me, our lips locked.  She tore lustfully at my remaining armour, flinging it to the ground, and I slid off her silken clothes, till we were left bare beneath the stars.  Then against a rocky outcrop we pressed against each other, still gasping and sweating from the fight.  There with blazing passion flesh met flesh and our hot moans rose into the cold night sky.]], "_t")

“Why are ye not leader?” asked Linaniil, resting her head in her hand with her naked form strewn across my bed.
 
I looked at her, surprised by the sudden question.  My mind struggled briefly with the strange query, still recovering from the heat of sex but a minute before.  “Why should I be leader?” I asked back.
 
“Because ye are strong, of course,” she responded.  “I deem ye stronger in battle than any of your kin.  Ye should rule with such strength.”
 
I chuckled softly.  “Mere strength is not enough to rule a people.  It requires responsibilities, careful decision making, and above all – politics.  I have no interest in such matters.  Ephinias is far better suited to those sorts of things.  Give me a sword and soldiers to lead into battle and I am content.  Let the leaders worry about where I should point my blade.”

She was quiet a moment, seemingly dissatisfied with that response.  “Ye are not happy with the current plans though.”

For a moment I was struck with shock.  It surprised me how clearly she divined my inner thoughts.  I had not expressed my concerns to anyone, yet she could so easily read me.  Five weeks it had been since we first met, and it seemed like there was nothing I could hide from her keen sight.
 
The preparations for the Spellblaze were well underway.  Turthel of the Kar’Krul had returned to his northern citadel, but he left his daughters as ambassadors to aid in our designs.  It meant Linaniil and I had many an opportunity to meet, though we kept it secret.  Few of my race would understand or approve of such a liaison, and none of us could afford a scandal. Yet I could not resist this human mage’s advancements, nor she mine.
 
“I am a warrior,” I said to her finally, getting brusquely from my bed and recovering my robes.  “I settle my battles facing my foe, not by toying with relics from afar.  It irks me that we must deal with our enemies in such a craven way.”

“But does it not excite ye, using these Sher’Tul ruins?” she said, putting a finger to her lower lip as she still languished in my bed, the sheets sticking tightly to her bare skin.  She seemed visibly aroused by her thoughts.  “Such powers lain dormant for so long, ready to be summoned to our control...  How it were I to command so great a venture!”

I shook my head sadly as I finished buttoning up my doublet.  “I do not trust those ruins.  We Shaloren are mighty, but we have yet to reach the heights of the Sher’Tul, nor do we truly understand the devices they have left behind.  My thoughts are more with your sister Neira on this.  We should stick to what abilities we have mastered, without stretching ourselves to such grand experimentation.”
 
Linaniil looked at me intently, a touch of humour in her dark eyes.  “If ye were leader then ye could stop this.  But then I would have to hate ye.”
 
I allowed myself a thin smile.  “Well, that would indeed be a terrible and dangerous thing.”  I finished dressing whilst Linaniil still lay in my bed, her face reflective.  “I must go now to check on the latest operations at the farportal.  You are welcome to join me.”
 
She shook her head languidly.  “Nay, I wish to rest more.  And besides, hearing their reports would but make me jealous.  Leave me here awhile – I wilst depart in secret later.”
 
I left my chamber then, dark thoughts now brooding at the back of my mind.  The date was coming closer when our plans would come to fruition and the Great Spellblaze would be unleashed.  A heavy foreboding lay over my heart.  Yet the alternatives seemed grim.  The war with the orcs was going badly, with few races able to secure their borders well and attacks from the brutes ever increasing.  Their numbers seemed inexhaustible.  Though they had little skill in warfare they could bring great harm to unprotected townsteads, and in enough force could bring down cities.  One human kingdom had collapsed under their attacks but a week before.  After that many who had initially rejected our plans came begging for our protection.  The Spellblaze seemed our only hope against imminent disaster.
 
Such thoughts were weighing on my mind as I passed from my chambers in the palace, down to the courtyard by the main gate.  Then from the corner of my eye I saw a swish of long red hair, and spun round thinking Linaniil had followed me.  But the golden robes and bright eyes of Neira revealed otherwise.
 
“Expecting someone else?” she asked with a wide smile, seeing the surprised look on my face.
 
“I was deep in thought,” I explained, bowing slightly to greet her.  “I am just on my way to inspect the farportal operations.  Perhaps you-“
 
“I shall join ye,” she said quickly, not waiting for my invitation.  I nodded my assent and guided her to my carriage.
 
As soon as we took off east the mood changed.  “She wilst only hurt ye,” said Neira suddenly.
 
I cursed quietly, understanding her meaning.  “Are there no secrets to be had in all Eyal?” I muttered.
 
“Not between sisters, and especially not between twins.”  She smiled warmly at me, yet there was no humour in her eyes.  “I mean it though.  I love mine sister, but I know her ways.  She be fickle, and willed to do her own thing when she likes.  Do not be surprised when she bores of ye.  Nor hurt.”
 
“I am quite capable of taking care of myself,” I said in clipped tone.
 
She gazed into my eyes a moment and then turned away to stare out the window.  “Well, I have warned ye...” she replied softly, a touch of sadness in her voice.
 
Was it jealousy perhaps that stirred such an outburst?  And for her sister’s attention or for mine?  I never did discover.  The rest of the trip was spent in sullen silence.  The sun was setting behind our carriage, casting a long shadow on the path ahead, and bathing the land about in crimson light.  It seemed for a moment like we rode into some demon’s plane, pitch black shadows melting into blood-red soil, whilst cold white stars began to spear through the sky above.  I shivered suddenly as the ruins came into view.
 
Few Sher’Tul ruins have been discovered which even come close to matching the grandeur of those which were near Elvala.  Many centuries our people spent excavating them, digging deep into the ground, ever careful not to damage or upset the relics.  The centrepiece was the Crystal Tower.  From the surface all that could be seen of it was a wide, even-sided square, which when cleaned of soil revealed a white stone smoother than marble.  But delving down our archaeologists found it plummeted deep, deep below the ground.  Half a mile it went down, the featureless white stone not bearing a single mark or engraving anywhere on its surface, until it ended suddenly and without foundation.  It was like the whole tower was separate from the earth, some strange thing of the stars that had dropped from the skies and lay sleeping beneath the soil.
 
Some years earlier our people had solved the invisible runes that allowed it to be opened, revealing vast crystal-lined halls and chambers arrayed in geometric patterns of sublime beauty.  Light sparked and shone from every surface, and the walls seemed to hum with energy.  Many shafts and passageways could only be navigated by flight, and at the top was found a grand room large enough to encompass the whole palace of Elvala.  At its centre was the farportal, a raised dais forty feet in diameter and crackling with energy upon which slowly spun a cloud of stars.  It was beautiful and frightening, enchanting and terrifying.  No power of the Shaloren could discern its operation, and though through careful experimentation we were able to manipulate its energies, never could we get a true grasp of the forces that lay beneath.

Neira and I descended to the base of the tower, smothered in the cold shadows of the excavated ruins.  I nodded to the guards as we passed through the square white entrance, and Neira’s eyes instantly enlarged in wonder.  The scintillating rooms were eye-catching to be sure, but they were also desolate and empty.  I tried to imagine what it must have looked like when filled with Sher’Tul.  “How did they all die?” I asked under my breath as we traversed the crystal halls, a question many had asked before.
 
The sorceress picked up on my words and laughed softly.  “It be a mystery, of course!  Mine mother once taught me that they killed themselves in a great civil war, using magics far beyond our imaginings.”
 
“I wonder,” said I.  We had our own records, of course, which we didn’t share with the younger races, but they were not so clear-cut as the many myths that had spread over the ages.
 
We reached the central shaft, and from there levitated up past floors and floors of abandoned chambers, living spaces, workshops, storerooms, and many other areas of purpose undivined by our loremasters.  Finally, after ascending for several minutes, we rose into the grand chamber of the farportal, and Neira gasped to see its size.  Her eyes soon settled on the great Sher’Tul farportal, sparks from it reflecting off the roof hundreds of feet above.  About it were bustling many of our Shaloren mages in silken robes, and Ephinias himself was leading the operations.
 
He broke from his advisers as he saw us arrive, and strode towards us with a confident smile on his face.  Though he wore the grey robes of a research mage he still bore his great golden staff, Luminis, token of his position as king.
 
“Ah, General Aranion!” he said, “You have come at last.  And brought the Kar’Krul girl with you; how splendid.”
 
I gave a small bow.  “Your majesty.  I am here for the update on our operations.”
 
“Yes, yes, of course,” he said with a dismissive hand gesture.  “And doubtless the girl is here to make sure we know what we’re doing?”
 
If Neira was offended she covered it up well.  “It would be mine delight to see evidence of ye skill and power over the ruins, lord Ephinias.”
 
The king smiled and nodded then, and called to some of his aides.  “Prepare the topography demonstration, using the acute fire strand.”  He turned back to us then.  “It is not mere skill and power of course that we can show you, but subtlety and scale too.  Now excuse me a moment whilst I join the others.”
 
He went with two of the senior research mages then to the front of the farportal.  They faced each other and began a low humming in unison, and slowly it seemed that the sparks from the farportal began to flicker redly.  Over the course of a few minutes their hum became a higher pitched chant, but softly sung and still in perfect unison.  As they raised their staffs there appeared above the farportal an image in flames, and looking at it both Neira and I marvelled, for we could see clearly that it was an image of ourselves, looking upwards, as if looking we were staring into a mirror.  Our features and movements were all clearly discernible, down the smallest detail, all carved out of flickering orange fire.
 
Then the chanting rose higher and it seemed the image zoomed out, so that we saw the farportal nearby us and the mages gathered about.  And still the focus soared upwards till we were but specks in a wide hall, until the image was displaced by a white square with carven edges dug into the earth about it, and I knew we were looking at the top of the Crystal Tower from above.  The view widened, and I could see the land rushing away, and the city of Elvala to the west.  The chanting rose higher and now the sea could be seen, and the mountains to the north-west, and all the land about.  And soon the continent was visible, right to the frozen north, and the ocean wrapped all about, and it seemed small white stars were dotted about the landscape.  The singing reached a crescendo and before us hung an image of the whole of Eyal, a globe of fire suspended in mid-air, slowly turning.
 
Then the chanting stopped and the image disappeared, and I could hear beside me Neira suddenly gasp for air, as if she had not dared draw breath through the last few minutes.
 
“You see now?” said Ephinias, grinning with pleasure.  “From the smallest detail to the grandest scale we can manipulate the farportal’s energy.  And did you see those white points marked across the image?  They are the other farportals spread across the world, and this one can connect to them all.  With careful, delicate control we can harmonise the energy of them all and use it to our will.  I’m afraid your sword can be no match to this, Aranion.”
 
I had no words to respond, and only nodded softly, still in awe of what I had seen.  Neira seemed the same, and I could see her now staring at the farportal with the same eager eyes as her sister.  She was converted.

I rode my great grey horse at a low trot, surrounded by my lieutenants and their elite cavalry and spellrangers.  Beside me on a brown mare my squire held high a banner emblazoned with a flame-wreathed sword, symbol of my personal entourage.  The pole seemed to shiver slightly in the young elf’s hands, a sign of nervousness.
 
“Hold that banner firm, boy,” I said in a commanding tone.
 
The squire suddenly sat upright in his saddle, and gripped tight on the banner pole.  “Yes, sire!” he said, alarmed.  “Whatever you say, sire!”  He kept his head faced forward but I could see his eyes glance towards me, desperate for approval.  Whatever I say indeed...  I had seen his gaze on me before, with all the adoration of a young soldier towards his commander, and perhaps a little more.  If I had not the joy of Linaniil’s company then the attention of such a pretty lad would not be unwelcome.  But this was not the time for such thoughts.
 
This would be the day, the day of the Spellblaze, and the boy had every right to be nervous.  It was a few hours after midnight, and already our scouts would be engaged alongside the other races, drawing out the orcs from their hiding places.  We marched through our main offensive lines, where we would hem them in before the great conflagration.  All around were arrayed spears and swords and mail, glistening in the starlight.  Troops upon troops of battlemages in purple robes held aloft glowing staves.  It was a sight to behold.  Yet we knew also the risk of engaging on open ground with the orcs in their full numbers.  If the Spellblaze failed then we would suffer greatly.

I set up camp upon a low hill overlooking the field, and then left my entourage to seek the Kar’Krul army to the north.  As I rode my stallion towards their station I could see smoke rising in the east.  Four thick grey plumes stood out against the pre-dawn light.  They would be villages looted and burned by the orcs as they rampaged against our feigned assaults.  The townsteads would be empty, but after this battle there would be nothing left for their residents to return to.  A small sacrifice in a game of war that spanned the continent.

A fifth column of smoke began to rise, and in the greenish haze of early morn those pillars of smoke suddenly seemed to look like a demonic hand stretching over the world, ready to dig its claws into the earth and rip out the flesh beneath.  This, I knew, was the threat the orcs faced to us all, a menace to all civilisation.  Whatever price we paid to stop them would be a small one.  So I thought.  So we all thought.
 
When I reached the Kar’Krul camp Linaniil came out to meet me.  Her smile was warm at the sight of me, but I could tell from her eyes that she was more excited for the events of the day.  “Just a few more hours,” she whispered like an impatient child.  “This will be fascinating!”
 
As I came in the Kar’Krul pavilion I saw Neira inside, and some of their senior mages and delegates from other human kingdoms.  I knew Turthel would not be with them, as he stayed in his northern city with his people.  It was not cowardice nor age that held him back from the front lines of war.  Indeed, it was said that ever since his wife was killed by the orcs he had to restrain himself from battle, lest his anger overcome him and he destroy friend and foe alike in his rage.  Yet it was known that sometimes he would venture through the lands alone, and he would bring with him a deafening storm of wrath, and the orcs would cower at the rumour of the approach of Turthel, Tempest of the North.
 
Neira and Linaniil commanded the Kar’Krul forces, and from the firm-set look on their archmages’ faces it was clear that they were ready for whatever the day would bring.  Yet Neira looked troubled, doubt evident in her eyes.
 
“What irks your sister?” I whispered to Linaniil.
 
“Some dumb dream,” she responded callously.
 
Neira’s eyes shot up.  “It were not a dream!” she barked.  “An omen it were, I tell ye!”  She turned to me then with pleading eyes.  “Ye must believe me, Aranion.  Something wilst go terribly wrong today.  I saw last night a terrible sight in mine dreams, as if it were a memory of long ago.  There were a burning city, made of glass and silver and marble.  And as it burned I did hear the cries of thousands, tens of thousands, young and old all dying.  And then the city fell, for it had been held in the sky, and it crashed down to the earth with a shattering torment that spilled across the land.  And other cities there were, and pillars of violet light struck up from them, and they did dance around filling the air with the scent of ozone and seared flesh.  Death was everywhere!  Death like none we have ever seen.
 
“It were no mere dream I tell ye.  It be a message, a warning - some forgotten tale of the dangers we play with.  We must stop this thing!”
 
Linaniil was tapping her foot impatiently as her sister raved, but I could see some of the other leaders looking worried.  I knew I had to quiet Neira down, so I drew myself near and put my hands on her shoulders, looking her calmly in the eyes and bringing my face close.
 
“It may well be that this is no dream.  For this is no normal day, and even in all the legends of ages past this will stand out as a day of reckoning.  Our civilisation in under peril, our way of life threatened from the orcish scourge.  We rest upon a knife edge, the world balancing on a pivot, and the wrong sway could tip us into darkness and despair forever.  Our actions today will decide this.  So yes, you have had a warning, you have had a message, and that message is to be strong.  For today we all hold the reins of fate in our palms, and only the steady hand can guide us past the threat of doom that is to come.  Neira, can you be that steady hand?”
 
She looked at me with open and hopeful gaze, her fingers clenched around my wrist as if she sought to draw strength from me.  She nodded slowly then.  “I’m sorry Aranion.  I just... I’ll be strong.”
 
I turned to the others who all seemed rapt by my words.  It was clear that leaving them to their own thoughts could only bring trouble.  I had to pull them into action straight away.  “It begins now!” I shouted.  “Gather your troops and prepare for the march.  Slow and steady we shall advance, carefully shall we hold the battle, and beyond fire and fury we will emerge free and victorious.  This day shall stand in history forever!  This day shall mark a new era for all the races!  The day of the Spellblaze is here!”

They all cheered and rushed to order their troops, taking courage from the duties of command.  Neira went to her own mages, and I left the pavilion alone.  But outside I was ambushed by Linaniil, who pulled me into an empty tent with a playful laugh.
 
“Ye said ye were no leader!” she exclaimed with a grin.  “That were a leader’s speech if ever I heard one.”

I shrugged and smiled modestly.  “I said what I had to.”
 
She drew close then, a sudden flush of worry in her face.  “It were just a dream, right?”  I could see then beneath all the bravado and humour she was mortally scared, her fingers trembling as she gazed into my eyes, yearning for reassurance.
 
“It was just a dream,” I lied, and it is a lie I have paid for with all my heart and soul.  “Everything will be all right.”  I pulled her close and wrapped my arms around her slender frame, and she held tight to me, still trembling slightly.
 
“Thank you, Aranion,” she whispered.  Turning up her face she kissed me, and it was the softest, most delicate kiss she ever gave me.  It was also the last.
 
We parted then, and I began the lonely ride back to my own troops.  My heart was now pounding like a deafening war drum, whilst the words of Neira still echoed round my head.  They stirred up a memory in me of a dream I myself had that morning, but that had laid dormant in my mind till then.  I was lying in my bed, and floating above me was a shape of light and air, like the figure of a creature I had never seen before.  It had long tentacles for arms, and billowing robes fluttered about it slowly.  Where it should have a head there was only a small bump, but I could tell it was focused on me.  It stretched out a long tentacle towards me, as if it were warding against a dark and dangerous threat.  A feeling came over me of terrible foreboding, the looming portent of a doom like no other the world had ever seen.  As the tip of the tentacle neared my brow everything went black.

Was it a dream?  Some strange foretelling?  Or could it have been a true apparition, something trying to give me a direct warning?  But I had no time for such thoughts.  The time of the Spellblaze was nearly upon us, and there could be no room for doubt.

I rode my great grey horse at a low trot, surrounded by my lieutenants and their elite cavalry and spellrangers.  Beside me on a brown mare my squire held high a banner emblazoned with a flame-wreathed sword, symbol of my personal entourage.  The pole seemed to shiver slightly in the young elf’s hands, a sign of nervousness.
 
“Hold that banner firm, boy,” I said in a commanding tone.
 
The squire suddenly sat upright in his saddle, and gripped tight on the banner pole.  “Yes, sire!” he said, alarmed.  “Whatever you say, sire!”  He kept his head faced forward but I could see his eyes glance towards me, desperate for approval.

I loosened Mooncutter in its sheath as the troops marched forwards.  My grip tightened on the reins, holding my horse in check lest it gallop ahead in the excitement, and I could see my squire to my left doing the same.  The tension in the air was palpable.  Before us, less than a mile away, the vanguard of the orcish armies was now visible.  We had stirred up their nest and they had responded in full force.  They were like a shadowy blight that swallowed up the horizon, a great pestilence that threatened to consume the world.  Before me the armies of the Shaloren seemed small in comparison, but I knew our strength was not told by mere numbers.

Trumpets blared from the bulwarks at the front, as they readied to engage with the first wave when needed.  To the north were archers to crumble the initial resistance, and at their flank a legion of spellriders, their hands glowing with arcane energies as they sat atop their fearsome steeds.  On the south was the regular cavalry, the greatswords, the armoured knights and the main bulk of our mages, readying support spells.  Here and there senior battlemages were dotted about, ready to move swiftly to points of intense activity and blast it away.  There was no need to have more than one of them in any place - alone they could decimate a score of orcs with ease.

Drums beat loudly in the distance, and a clamour arose from the enemy.  They had with them trained beasts and trolls, and were arrayed in swords and maces and crude armours.  One took up a loud howl and others joined in, and the air seemed to reverberate with their ugly voices.

The cacophony was unsettling, but my army responded with a display of power.  Swords and speartips rose into the air, and crackles of lightning shot up to the heavens, the sparks shining off the gleaming blades and armour.  The orcish army gasped in dismay.  The eastern skyline was beginning to glow red, and we knew the dawn would break any moment now, the signal for the start of the Great Spellblaze.

“The day is here!” one of our warriors shouted out, and it was taken up elsewhere by the marching troops.  “The day is here!” they began to chant, anticipating the glory to come.  “The day is here!” my squire sang, his voice full of youthful joy and hope.  “The day is here!” we all shouted in unison, the pride of the Shaloren kingdom in our hearts as we watched the first rays of sunlight shine out from the horizon.  “The day is here!  The day is here!  The day is-”

Silence.  All at once our voices dropped, and a terrible brooding silence swept over the battlefield.  We could feel it, every one of us, so attuned are our race to the flows of magic.  It was like having the breath sucked from one’s lungs, or the earth disappear from beneath one’s feet.  All our mana channels were gone, changed suddenly, arcane energies beyond all reach.  Groans and murmurs began to arise, as mages clutched at their heads in sudden despair.  I saw my squire lurch forwards in his saddle and begin to vomit uncontrollably, my standard slipping from his hand, whilst others fell to the ground in pain.  I struggled to battle an overwhelming migraine, blotches appearing in front of my eyes, and with great effort of will I managed to keep control of myself and began to seek out new paths of mana.

But there was something wrong, terribly wrong.  Like a river run off its course the flow of magic across the whole of Eyal had changed.  What could have caused this?  And now I had to fight years of attunement and training that had taught me to naturally rely on the known flows and courses so that I might find new paths, new sources.  And as I did so I put my powers into divination, and what I discovered shocked me to my core.

The orcs saw us in disarray and began to charge.  But my attention was turned west, not east, towards Elvala and the Crystal Tower where our leaders had been manipulating the Sher’Tul farportal.  But the tower, I felt, was gone - crumpled into the earth, and from there now emanated a wave of white-hot flame.  The orcs tore into our army with little resistance, their weapons tearing through the elven troops, but they were soon met by a wave of destructive energy far greater.

“Shields!” I shouted out as the whole sky turned redder than blood, but above the sudden deafening roar of roasting air I was not heard.  It would have helped little anyway, defenceless as my army was without their usual sources of mana.  Spears of flame streaked down on our heads, shearing through flesh and steel in an instant and sinking into the earth.  The ground shook, and lava blasted up from the deep holes torn into the rock.

I put an arcane shield about myself with a great effort of will.  I saw my squire raise a hand to do the same, but a blaze tore off his arm.  He didn’t even get to scream before another wave burned through the top half of his torso.  Spurting blood evaporated instantly, and the air became full of red mist and fire.  I leapt from my horse as it neighed and stumbled and fell burning into ash.

Another wave came, and I tried to strengthen my shield, but the force of it took me off my feet and sent me flying.  I was thrashed through the air like a swirling leaf, unable to do anything more than struggle to maintain my protection.  All about my army was being utterly decimated, ranks and ranks of soldiers and mages burnt to a crisp or torn apart by the raw energies.  The orcs were the same, and a huge rent in the ground swallowed great numbers of their troops.  Blasts of lava soon thundered upward and rained down for miles around, turning into glowing rivers of death that swept across the consumed landscape.

How I managed to stay alive I am still not sure.  I almost slipped from consciousness at several points, but by a mental tenacity I never knew I had I managed to stay focused and keep my protective shield active.  I became less aware of my surroundings, not knowing if the bubble of my ward was floating through air or fire or blood, or swallowed into the depths of Eyal into some hell never before witnessed.  At last, after what seemed like a tortuous age, the wave of energy passed, and I found myself lying alone on an outcrop of cracked and parched earth, the air a haze of heat about me.

I struggled to my feet and looked around, seeing nothing but desolation in all directions.  Steam and smoke rose from rents in the ground, and blood, limbs and ashes were strewn about all over.  Nothing was alive.  In a daze I despaired that I was alone of the hundreds of thousands who had stood here but a short while before.  Friends and comrades, mentors and students, people I had never known and ones I was dearly close to - all gone.  A sudden pain lanced my heart as I thought of Linaniil.  She could not be dead, surely?

I gritted my teeth and summoned the energy to levitate, and as I rose I began to get my bearings around the changed landscape.  Slowly I pushed north-east, passing over devastation beyond belief.  I struggled to keep a grip on my sanity as the scent of burnt flesh and blood surrounded me, my vision filled with a horrored landscape beyond imagination, the utter silence more deafening than any sound I had ever heard.  Eventually I came near to where the Kar’Krul army had stood, and cast about the ruined land for some sign of life.  Then faintly I detected something, some small sliver of life, and searching it out I found her.

Her clothes had been mostly burned off, her hair half turned to ash, and blood was seeping freely from burns all across her body.  A weak shield still hummed over her, but as I knelt down and laid a hand on her it vanished.  Quietly she gasped a breath before whispering, “Neira”, and sinking into unconsciousness.  She was still alive, but barely.  I looked about and saw no signs of her sister, or of any of the rest of her troops, other than the scorched flesh and blackened bones that marked the scourging path swept by the blaze.

I began to cast what healing spells I could on Linaniil, but I could tell it was not enough, and my weakened powers could not hope to save her.  I began to cry openly, thinking of all I had lost this day, all that had gone so terribly wrong.  Hope had turned to crisis, and the cruelty of fate was far too much for me to bear.  Cradling my dying love’s head in my lap I turned my face to the sky and screamed.  Torment was in my cracked voice, and I raged against all the injustice of life and the futility of war, surrounded on all sides by blood and bones and ashes.  They had once been souls and lives with hopes and dreams, now all cast away like dust in the wind, and I lamented their deaths and my despair.

But mine was just one voice, one torment, a single note in the great cacophony that spread across the continent.  Millions of lives lost and shattered, millions of voices raised in anguish and torture and suffering, as the devastation continued over all Maj’Eyal from the ultimate force of destruction, the Spellblaze.]], [[#{italic}#From the memoirs of Aranion Gawaeil, leader of the Grand Council of Elvala#{normal}#

Friends and comrades, mentors and students, people I had never known and ones I was dearly close to - all gone.  A sudden pain lanced my heart as I thought of Linaniil.  She could not be dead, surely?

I gritted my teeth and summoned the energy to levitate, and as I rose I began to get my bearings around the changed landscape.  Slowly I pushed north-east, passing over devastation beyond belief.  I struggled to keep a grip on my sanity as the scent of burnt flesh and blood surrounded me, my vision filled with a horrored landscape beyond imagination, the utter silence more deafening than any sound I had ever heard.  Eventually I came near to where the Kar’Krul army had stood, and cast about the ruined land for some sign of life.  Then faintly I detected something, some small sliver of life, and searching it out I found her.

Her clothes had been mostly burned off, her hair half turned to ash, and blood was seeping freely from burns all across her body.  A weak shield still hummed over her, but as I knelt down and laid a hand on her it vanished.  Quietly she gasped a breath before whispering, “Neira”, and sinking into unconsciousness.  She was still alive, but barely.  I looked about and saw no signs of her sister, or of any of the rest of her troops, other than the scorched flesh and blackened bones that marked the scourging path swept by the blaze.

I began to cast what healing spells I could on Linaniil, but I could tell it was not enough, and my weakened powers could not hope to save her.  I began to cry openly, thinking of all I had lost this day, all that had gone so terribly wrong.  Hope had turned to crisis, and the cruelty of fate was far too much for me to bear.  Cradling my dying love’s head in my lap I turned my face to the sky and screamed.  Torment was in my cracked voice, and I raged against all the injustice of life and the futility of war, surrounded on all sides by blood and bones and ashes.  They had once been souls and lives with hopes and dreams, now all cast away like dust in the wind, and I lamented their deaths and my despair.

But mine was just one voice, one torment, a single note in the great cacophony that spread across the continent.  Millions of lives lost and shattered, millions of voices raised in anguish and torture and suffering, as the devastation continued over all Maj’Eyal from the ultimate force of destruction, the Spellblaze.]], "_t")

Perhaps what happened will never be truly understood.  What Sher’Tul ruins survived the Spellblaze have been little touched since - the burned hand learns its lesson.  But we know that Ephinias and his mages lost control somehow, whatever delicacy and balance they wrought with coming untangled.  At the moment they tried to connect to the other farportals the imbalance was reverberated, resonated, magnified beyond control.  The farportal in the Crystal Tower imploded in a fraction of a second, killing all within and crushing the land about.  The energies in the Sher’Tul relics then erupted in a blaze of white light, turning the air to fire and the ground to ruin.  The blaze swept eastwards, rolling over our battle with an unstoppable destructive force, and then carrying on towards the Thaloren lands.  Most of the ancient forests of Shatur were ripped from their roots, and the lands lain cursed ever since.

Meanwhile the other farportals all over Maj’Eyal erupted, white stone cracking and vast swathes of energy spilling forth.  All of the Cornac lands to the west were turned to desert, the dwarven halls of Korhek crumpled, the midvale plains were risen up as mountains and Lake Nur formed in their wake.  In the south the ancient tower of Darafel was collapsed, and the forests beside it morphed into an ever-broiling scar of lava and blackened earth.  Far in the east the Naloren farportal, the largest of all in Maj’Eyal, disappeared in a vast earthquake that swallowed everything for miles around, and boiling water spewed up to fill its cavernous depths.

And whilst this destruction was wrought the incredible energies disrupted all of the mana flow around Eyal.  Streams of energy that followed set, slowly changing courses, now were flooded and droughted, warped and split.  The threads of the elements were in vast disarray, and any attuned to magic suddenly found themselves far away from their accustomed power sources.

Even the Heavens were changed.  The wandering star of Vor disappeared, the constellations were tilted off their normal course, and the seasons rent harsher since.  Some say the moons dimmed and the sun went whiter after that day.  I do not know.  The whole world has seemed darker to me.

The numbers killed are beyond count.  The initial destruction took at least five million lives, and the terror that followed claimed far more.  For though it had been a day of tragedy and immeasurable woe, it was to be followed by a bloody age of darkness and torment.

But none of this I knew as I lay weeping in the aftermath, cradling in my lap the one life I cared about.  In abject misery I called on all the healing powers I could to bring her back to me for but one moment.  Her heart beat softly, and her eyes opened, but seemed glassy and far away.

“Linaniil,” I whispered, and her dark eyes turned towards my face.  I tried to mumble an apology, to say I was sorry and was unable to help her, but emotions overcame my voice.  Her gaze at me was empty, as if she looked right through me, before she turned her eyes away.  Slowly she raised a hand to an amulet about her neck, and with a light touch it glowed and then cracked.  Her eyes closed again but I could feel the power from the artifact pumping into her, strengthening her heart-beat and mending her flesh.  She was unconscious and still badly wounded, but for now the mortal threat was gone.

My thoughts were mixed - glad she was no longer at death’s door, but worried she might relapse, and at the back of my mind scared of that empty look she had given me.  Could she possibly forgive my part in this?

Carefully I picked up her frail body, and began the journey back to Elvala.  Two days it took on foot, through blasted and ruined ground.  On the passage I came across other survivors, refugees now leaving their destroyed homes, heading to the city to seek shelter.  I tried to nurse Linaniil as best I could, giving her water during brief periods of waking and dressing her wounds, but true healing could not happen till I reached the city.

Elvala was a quiet chaos, oppressed by fear and uncertainty, an air of dread filling all the streets.  The news had broken that our army had been entirely wiped out - there would be no loved ones returning to their families, and the sound of stifled mourning was to be heard in all corners of the city.

I took Linaniil straight to the healing grounds in the palace and gave her to the doctors with the strictest instructions.  They were swamped by casualties, but followed my orders without question, tending immediately to her wounds and applying tinctures and regenerative spells.

It was as I watched over her quietly that a party bustled loudly into the grounds.  I recognised at their head was Perissa, a senior court official.  At her side was an elderly human who immediately went to where Linaniil lay.

“General Aranion!” announced Perissa loudly, “I heard you were here, but I could scarce believe it.  Thank the threads you have returned to us!  This is a grave time; we must talk at once.”

But I ignored her as I saw the human touch Linaniil’s hand, and her eyes gently open.  “Cuilan?” she murmured softly.

“Aye, it is me, my lady,” he said quietly.  “I have been sent here by your father.  He has ordered me to pass you this.”  And with that he brought forth a golden ring set with a fiery ruby.  I recognised it immediately as the Ring of Kar’Krul, worn by the mighty Turthel.  Linaniil sat up quickly, wincing from the pain, but with her eyes locked on the ring as it was placed in her hand.

“But mine father...”

“I’m sorry, my lady.  It brings me great sorrow to bear you this news.  Your father and his court are dead.  His last act was to instruct me to bring this ring to you and your sister.  Neira...” he said glancing about.  “Is she...?”  He saw the look in Linaniil’s eyes and dipped his head despondently.  “I see.  I am terribly sorry.  It becomes my duty then, my lady, to declare you the new leader of the Kar’Krul.”

“General Aranion,” interjected Perissa.  “I really must speak with you now!”

“Wait!” I barked, and turned to the human Cuilan.  “What is happening here?  How could one such as Turthel be killed?”

The man looked at me then with a wan sadness in his eyes, before turning to address Linaniil.  “Yesterday, the day after the terrible Spellblaze, as we began some attempt at reconstruction, still struggling to realign our mana paths, a murmur began amongst the people.  It spoke thus: The Kar’Krul circle of mages had betrayed the ordinary people.  They accused us of siding with the elves to destroy non-mages, of toying with terrible powers beyond our control, of deliberately massacring them out of evil and malice.  We could not logic with them, they would listen to no reason, and they rose up in violent anger.  They attacked many of us, with farming instruments and whatever weapons they could find.  Our defences were weak, and striking back just made the crowd fiercer.  We retreated to your father’s home, begging for help, but he shook his head and said he could not fight back.  They came for us then, storming his palace, and Turthel ordered all to put up no resistance.  He handed me his ring, saying to seek you out in Elvala, and then stepped outside to face the crowds.  He didn’t resist!  The people... they... they...”  He lapsed into sullen silence, shaking his head in sorrow.  He looked like he wanted to cry, but had no tears left to shed.  Linaniil’s face was graven and she stared hard at the ring.

Perissa grabbed me then and turned me to her attention.  “This is what I need to speak with you about, General Aranion.  If this human’s tale is to be believed then we are in very grave danger!  Scout reports suggest there is a body of humans coming here from the north as we speak.  From what this human says they seek retribution - they wish to slaughter us all.  A storm of wrath lies on our borders and we are defenseless!  We need you desperately to organise our defence, to protect our city and our people.”

I felt numb, the events overwhelming me.  “But who leads us?” I said.

“There is no one.  What royals are known to be alive are not suited.  We are entering a time of war, a terrible time like no other we have ever faced.  We need military leadership.  You, General Aranion, you must be our leader.”

I held Perissa’s gaze then and saw the wisdom in her words.  My duty as a Shaloren was clear.  But my heart tremored as I turned to look at Linaniil.

“This be our path then, Aranion,” she said quietly, raising herself from the bed and carefully placing the ring on the middle finger of her right hand.  “I must tend to mine people, and ye to yours.  We will not meet again.”

“But your wounds-” I tried to object.

“Will never heal!” she cried, hate dripping from her voice.  Her eyes were like cold and impenetrable ice, a smouldering anger deep within.  “Come, Cuilan, we must leave this place.”  And with that they departed, Linaniil walking tall and proud in spite of her injuries.

I closed off my heart and my emotions then, lest they overwhelm me.  My duty was before me, and the events of the past had to be locked away from memory.

The ceremony was organised in under an hour, and I was anointed leader of the Grand Council of Elvala, head of the Shaloren people.  On my order rangers began transporting in survivors from outpost settlements, whilst I commanded our remaining mages to begin a new endeavour around our city walls.

The first waves of the storm of hate came the next day.  Human peasants and farmers, ordinary workers armed poorly, their looted swords and spears badly wielded.  I stood alone at our gates as they approached, Mooncutter in my hand.  When the first few charged at me I thrust the blade into the soil and tore a great chasm in the earth, and our mages summoned forth mists and smoke that rose from the ground and began to surround our whole city.  As the peasants stumbled in confusion archers started firing from our walls.  What few made it through the smoke and arrows I took on, tearing Mooncutter through their flesh with little resistance.  Their blood gushed out in the gallons, drenching our ground, staining my skin.  It was like a warm shower over my boiling emotions, a bath of blood to wash over my sins.

The Shroud of Elvala was begun, as our whole city was wreathed in cloud and smoke.  Our shield, our mask, our hiding.  It would last for centuries, the only dealings with the outside world being in furtive secrecy.

We veiled our guilt, cloaked our crimes.  Though we had some communication with the outside through halfling traders and the odd disguised Shaloren adventurer, we remained mute to the world at large, hidden from their accusing gaze.  Outside our quiet walls others had not the luxury of hiding.  The Spellhunt was begun, and it knew no mercy.

Ordinary people rose up against what they perceived as the arrogance of the mages, a revolt against the power of the few that had ruined the lives of so many.  Any suspected of sorcery or ties to the Art were cruelly dealt with.  There was sympathy for none, and many innocents fell victim to the unquenchable thirst for retribution.  The madness swept across the whole of Maj’Eyal.

Law and order had broken down.  Armies, territories and whole cities had been destroyed or ravaged by the Spellblaze, with many areas left completely uninhabitable.  Kingdoms fell and tyrants arose.  Bandits picked at the bones of civilisation like vultures on a rotten corpse.

An organisation called the Ziguranth, thought dead long ago, came into resurgence, gaining popular support from the people in their anti-magic crusade.  We heard of some mages going into hiding, but inevitably being rooted out, or fleeing desperately from place to place.  Dark tales also arose of necromancers and fell wizards creating dungeons and strongholds, fending off or evading attacks, and beginning reigns of terror.

And one tale came to my ears of a group of mages that managed to band together and stay in hiding, though always on the run from the chasing Ziguranth.  The story from outside was that they were led by a demon with fiery hair, fiercely glowing eyes and hands wrapped in flames, that fought with blazing wrath and could be opposed by none.  I knew that description well...

I carried out my reign, my duty, taking care of the Shaloren people.  We were safe from attackers, secure in our supplies through discrete trade, and slowly building back some of what we had lost.  But both fear and shame prevented us from showing our face to the world.

Fifteen long years passed before I awoke one night in my council chambers, the crescent Wintertide moon softly illuminating a shape near the end of my bed.  The figure was tall and slim, wrapped in tight-fitting wools and furs.  Her crimson hair stirred gently as she stood with her back to me.  Memories arose of a night long ago, in a more innocent time, when a younger me and a younger her first became close.

I barely dared to whisper her name, afraid that she might disappear, an apparition or a dream that could be broken by a spoken word.  “Linaniil,” I softly mouthed.  She turned to me, and I saw those same dark eyes I remembered.  But they were surrounded by lines of care, the markings of years of strain and responsibility clear on her face.

Rising from my bed I gathered a robe about me.  I took a few steps towards her but stopped, not able to move myself any further.  I wanted to be near her, to put my arms around her, but it felt as if she were across a wide chasm from me, a gulf of time and pain between us.

“I have come for help, Aranion,” she said in a low voice, not quite meeting my gaze.  “There be something I seek, and ye must aid me in achieving it.”  I did not understand, but I nodded my assent.  “Get ye dressed and ready then.  There be a long journey ahead of us.”

She stepped towards the window, her back towards me again, waiting as I put on a stralite mail and gathered my sword.  When she noticed I was ready she levitated out, and I followed.

We whistled through the air, travelling northwards at great speed.  The lands swept beneath us, and the climate grew colder as we went further and further north.  Hours passed in intrepid silence, till we were flying above snowy tundra.  We soared past plains of white and grey before we reached a low range of hills.  Here Linaniil slowed and descended, and I went down beside her.  We came to rest before a dark opening at the foot of the hills.

Linaniil stood for a while staring at the black cave.  Fear radiated from her face, but her eyes were hard and determined.  “It is here,” she said quietly, her voice steady.  I followed her gaze, trying to guess what secrets this remote place contained, but I could sense nothing special.

She marched forwards and I followed, until we came right up to the shadowed opening.  Linaniil hesitated a moment, staring into the blackness, before finally stepping inside and being swallowed from sight.  I could feel it then, the sensation that something ancient lay in this place.  My skin tingled and my arcane attunement felt on fire.  This dark cave held some mysterious force, secluded from all knowledge since the oldest days of Eyal.  There was something here that could change the destiny of the world.

Light sprung from Linaniil’s staff, and she cast about a luminescence, revealing a narrow icy passageway that led downwards.  It was deathly cold, and our breaths condensed in clouds as we made our way down the wending tunnels.  My skin pricked, and all my senses seemed on edge.

“What is down here?” I asked, my curiosity all-consuming.

“Power,” Linaniil responded, not looking at me as she spake, continuing to follow the path.  “And power be what I seek.  I am afeared for mine people, but have not the strength to protect them as I wouldst like.  With what be here, perhaps, I shall have the power to make a safe haven.  This be a place of legend amongst mine people, and I have scouted it out over many years.  Today I shall finally reach what lies at the centre.”

“And why do you need me?”

She didn’t respond, but carried onwards.  We reached a split in the tunnel, and without hesitation Linaniil took the left path.  It led further and further underground.  We came to blockages, but by arcane force the sorceress easily cleared a way.

As we passed through a large cavern I sensed movement, and drew Mooncutter quickly.  What looked like a disembodied limb, or some great thrashing worm, was writhing towards us pathetically.  Linaniil send a blast of fire towards it - it squealed and went still.

And then more movement, a hundred movements.  From crevasses and holes in the walls and ceiling there burst out dozens upon dozens of the worm-like creatures, their maggoty bodies flapping rigorously, fanged mouths opening up and screaming torturous sounds.  Linaniil growled and began sending torrents of flame towards the approaching horde.  I covered her back, slicing open their pale green flesh and sending strokes of lightning through their ranks.  In under a minute we had dispatched them all.

I prodded a corpse with my foot and it collapsed into sludge.  “What strange creatures,” I commented.  I looked at Linaniil for some explanation but she simply proceeded forward.  I followed after, keeping my sword in hand and watching closely for further attacks.

At the other end of the cavern a wall of ice blocked our way.  Linaniil held up the Ring of Kar’Krul, and the jewel on it began to blaze.  The ice melted away slowly, revealing a passage to another, smaller chamber.

This cold, crypt-like hollow was covered in smooth, glistening ice on all sides.  The walls were square and straight, and ancient pillars of marble were dotted about the room.  On the pillars and walls were weathered runes and symbols.  I came close to study some, but couldn’t recognise them from any of my studies.  “What was this place?” I asked, turning to Linaniil.  “It seems older even than Sher’Tul.”

She ran her hand over one of the walls, tracing the outline of a door.  “It be a temple to Quekorja, god of a race whose name somehow escapes my mind.  The were killed off by the Sher’Tul long before our races were born.  They did build this temple in honour of Quekorja, and the last of them did die here defending her.”

I looked about in awe.  Though I had explored many Sher’Tul ruins I hadn’t seen anything like this.  The architecture was simple but elegant.  There was a crude beauty to it all.  I turned back to the door Linaniil was examining.

She was trying to open it, but was obviously struggling to find a way.  “There be some key, some puzzle to open this,” she muttered.  “But I can nay solve it - the secret be lost to time.”  She growled in anger and stood back.  Holding out her staff she unleashed a blast of arcane force from it, violently splitting the stone door apart and tearing open a passage to a chamber beyond.

Many things suddenly happened at once.  From beyond I felt a pulse of energy, a huge surge of power that I had never felt before.  Linaniil was focussed on it intensely.  But noise came from all around of creatures moving asudden.  From the cave we had entered from there was a shriek of a hundred wailing voices, and the floor beneath our feet trembled.  Rocks fell from the ceiling and out burst horrific creatures with spiked limbs and smooth, triangular faces.  From the trembling ground arose a strange ethereal being of light, with long tentacles for limbs.  And as I turned to face these threats I saw that in the previous cavern the worms had come back to life, and were now coalescing into a huge mass of putrid flesh.

I tried to cut through the being of light, but my sword barely slowed as it passed through it, and the flames I summoned seemed to have little effect.  It raised a tentacle towards me and an intensely bright beam of light shone from it through my torso, filling my flesh with searing pain.  I jumped back and send a wave of ice at it, tearing off a tentacle and pushing it further away.  Meanwhile Linaniil had reduced one of the spiked creatures to a pile of ash, but her arcane shield was collapsing beneath the slashes of the others, and more were spilling from the ceiling.  In the entranceway the mass of worms was pressing through, and from the mouths of the flailing bodies came spits of burning acid.

We were at severe risk of getting surrounded in this confined space, the numbers too many to take on at once.  “Over here!” shouted Linaniil, as she dashed through the door she had split apart.  I followed, slashing my blade through the mass of worms, causing it to lurch back screeching in pain, and spearing a blast of lightning through one of the spiked creatures, splitting open its head.  It continued to attack me, but I parried and cut its arm off, dancing around it and reaching the doorway.  With my back to the opening I brought up a wall of water and sent it flooding into the chamber, pushing the horrors away as I leapt backwards through the door.

As soon as I passed through Linaniil thrust her staff into the ground and a pillar of rock rose upwards, sealing off the opening.  I could hear thrashing and thumping sounds from the other side, but for now we seemed safe.  “What were those things?!” I asked incredulously, as I scanned around the open cavern for signs of any more creatures.  It was a large space, but everything was still, and I could see no other entrances.

“Scions of Amakthel,” she responded calmly.  “The butchered god seeks to break his chains.  But he needs more power...  And here in this dark, forgotten place is part of that power he seeks.”

“And what is here?  What terrible power lies here that would draw both you and those horrors?!”

“Quekorja,” she said.

“Quekorja?  The... the god?”  I couldn’t believe I what I was hearing.  “Was it not slain by the Sher’Tul?”

“Aye, that it were.  But there be power even in a slain god.  Look behind ye, Aranion.”

I turned then, wondering what she wanted me to behold.  It took me a moment to see it, but when I did I gasped in shock.  The far wall of this great cavern was not merely a wall.  It was covered in a thick layer of ice, but beneath at its centre I could make out a huge yellow eye.  And around that eye I could trace out a giant form.  Dark grey skin covered a bulging head, topped with three great curved horns, which sat atop a long, thick body with six limbs.  It was deathly still and chillingly ancient, seeming more like part of the rock than anything that had once been alive.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, but I could feel it.  In that corpse was still power, immense power, like nothing I had ever felt before.

“This be it,” said Linaniil.  “One of the few corpses of the gods left to find in Maj’Eyal.  And I shall take its power as mine own.”

“This is insane!” I shouted.  “You have no idea if that is safe or not.  You don’t know what it will do to you!”

She chuckled darkly.  “Aye, that be true.  But that is why I have brought ye here.”  I looked at her in confusion and she chuckled again.  “Ye still know not your purpose here.  Did ye think I took ye here for protection?  That I couldst not handle those horrors on mine own?  No, there be a different reason I have brought ye.  When I absorb this corpse, when I take its power for mine own, I do not know what wilst become of me.  It may kill me.  Or it may drive me mad, it may turn me into something terrible.  Should that happen, Aranion, you art the only one I know with the strength to kill me.”

The words hit me like a blow to the chest.  “Kill you?  But I couldn’t...”

“But ye must!” she said firmly.  “After all ye have done... all the torture ye have brought my life... ye owe me this.”  I looked deep into her eyes and saw the turmoil of emotions within, the pain and agony of all that had befallen her, the hatred and blame of those who had wronged her, the guilt and shame for not being able to do more herself.  And deep inside still some touch of love for me and what we had shared.  I reached out my hand and stroked her soft hair, my fingers touching lightly against the side of her face.  I leaned in close and she closed her eyes, turning her face up to me as I moved my lips towards hers.

“No!” she suddenly cried, pushing me back.  “It cannot be!”  She swiftly turned from me, and I saw a tear drip down one cheek.  “The world has changed, Aranion.  I have a duty before me, and none can walk that path beside me.”  And with that she began to run, staff in hand, towards the great eye whose dead gaze was locked behind the wall of ice.  I sprinted after her, but she was faster, and with running leap she thrust the base of her staff through the ice and into the center of the god’s eye.

The ice cracked with a deafening thunder, and the giant yellow eye pulsed before exploding in a ball of light.  I stopped and covered my eyes as white light flooded the room and shards of ice flew through the air.  I could barely make out Linaniil, bathed in light, hanging with one hand from her staff, her hair and robes blown backwards as she reached forwards with her other arm.  Slowly, intrepidly, she placed her hand into the centre of the ball of light where the eye had been, and shadows danced about the cavern as she wrapped her fingers round that luminous sphere, before squeezing tight.

The cavern shook, her staff shattered, the wall creaked and split before wholly blasting apart.  The corpse of the dead god collapsed into a stream of silver and in a roaring cacophony rushed towards Linaniil, tearing apart her robes and sinking into her skin.  She floated in the air, limbs outstretched as the vast energy poured into her flesh.  She opened her mouth as if to scream and light burst out, and light spilled from her eyes and ears.  The cavern quaked dangerously and rocks fell from the walls and ceiling.  But in seconds it was over, the corpse of the god fully absorbed, the light in Linaniil’s eyes went out, and she dropped to the ground like a stone.

Then the horrors broke through, the collapsing cavern having made an opening for them, and immediately they sped hungrily to where Linaniil lay.  “No!” I cried, rushing to intercept them.  “You cannot have her!”

I sliced off the head of a spiked creature and put up a wall of fire ahead of the rest of them as I backed towards Linaniil’s body.  She looked dead, with no sign of movement or breathing, but I had no time to check.  The being of light and tentacles passed through my flames without resistance, and I ran sparks along my sword as I tore it up the centre of the monster.  It shot light through my torso and I coughed up blood, but I forced my sword in deeper and ran a flood of arcane energy through it, blowing the thing apart.  More spiked creatures came, and I took care of my footing whilst parrying and chopping on my left and sending waves of flame to my right.

The mass of worms broke through the wall, and with it two more luminous horrors, and some fiend of darkness and nightmares, and I could see behind others were spilling through.  I put up a shield as rays of light shot towards me, and sent balls of frost back at them.  One of the light beings fell, whilst the other was slowed.  The dark thing came quickly, and the mass of worms not far behind, so I sliced my sword across the ground, sending heat through it, and turned the stone into a mass of lava.  The dark thing came around it, and I felt an aura of deathly cold from it as it approached.  I hacked at it desperately, and it shot back speared limbs towards my chest that seemed to suck all strength from me.  With a roar I shot a pulse of flames down my blade and it burst apart.  The worms charged directly over the lava, squealing in pain as a bulk of them were burned, but coming at me with speed.  I adjusted my grip, getting ready to make deft strokes to stay out of its range, but a lance of light then shot through my leg, dropping me to one knee with a scream.  The mass of worms rushed at me then, and I dug my sword deep into their midst, but the worms crawled over my arms, digging their acidic teeth into my flesh and reaching for my neck.  With my left arm I cast a blanket of flames over them, burning my arm along with the screeching worms.  They pulled away slightly, but the being of light was approaching from the side, a tentacle flaring up in luminescent energy, and three spiked horrors were behind it.  My right arm was burnt, my left leg injured, my mail pocked with holes, and my mana reserves were running low.  But I gritted my teeth in determination - I could not back from this fight.  I rushed at the mass of worms with my sword held firm.

It exploded in a fiery mess, and an intense wave of force and fire blasted across the cavern, turning the other horrors to ash, and even burning through the luminous being - a low scream arising from it as the flames tore it apart.  I gasped, not knowing whence this blaze had come, until I turned around and saw Linaniil.  She was standing tall, her robes burnt off, flames dancing up and down her skin, bright light shining from her eyes.  Heat seemed to radiate from her.  I kept my grip on my sword, not sure if this was the Linaniil I knew, or some other force born of her union with the dead god.

She laughed suddenly, and it was a harsh laugh that I had not heard her make before.  “What a fool I have been,” she said, almost to herself.  “I brought ye here in case ye had to stop me.  But now...  Now mine power exceeds ye by a long distance.  Ye would have no hope of opposing me!”  She made a low sound somewhere between a laugh and a sigh.  “Ah, but ye have no cause to worry.  I am still me.  Mostly.  And through pain and sacrifice I have achieved the power I desired.  The power I need.”

I let my sword dip and breathed heavily, relief mingled with trepidation sweeping through me, whilst the withdrawing adrenalin of battle left me feeling exhausted.  I looked Linaniil over, her pale skin now glowing, her eyes brimming with energy and vitality.  I saw the power she had was not in mere force, but that she had taken on the ageless nature of the gods.  A power forbidden to all creatures was now hers and hers alone.

“What now?” I said quietly.

“Now, ye go home, and I go to make mine home, a sanctuary for me and mine people.”

“Will we meet again?”

She smiled sadly.  “Mayhaps.  Mayhaps not.  The world changes quicker than predictions can tell.  But if we do meet again it shall be in a place that does not yet exist - the city of Angolwen.”  She raised an arm then and from it shot a tremendous pulse of arcane energy, the violet light shooting to the roof of the cavern and spearing through, deep through, till it split the rock apart right through to the open sky a mile above.  Sunlight spilled down, splashing over Linaniil’s lithe form.  It had been many hours since this long long night had begun.

“But for now, farewell Aranion,” she said as she began to float from the ground.  And then she sped up and soared out of sight.

I lay down on the cold stone, resting for a while, slowly healing my wounds and recovering my strength.  I reflected on the events since the evening before, thinking back on the trials of all the races of Maj’Eyal.  War, disease and death threatened all equally.  Was Linaniil beyond that now?  How would a taste of immortality affect her?

It was then that thought for our race came to me.  In ages past we had searched for immortality.  Our ancestral leaders had obsessed over it, but out of vanity, pride and a fear of death.  What would the real effects be if all our society were to be gifted with it?  With immortal life we might separate ourselves from the strifes and wars of the world.  It would give us a perspective beyond the petty squabbles and prideful competition of the other races.

I dug through the ice and rocks and found still some trace of the dead god Quekorja, faint though it were.  I gathered all that was left and made the long journey back to Elvala.  There I retreated to my labs, studying the remains for years before finally unlocking its secrets.  It was thus that immortality for our race was born, and it has changed our outlook on the world ever since.

We stood apart from the others then, not engaging in war, finding a new respect for life.  It was not till Garkul the Devourer assaulted our gates in the Age of Pyre that we ever had cause for large scale war again, and I rode out to face him in combat.

Light sprung from Linaniil’s staff, and she cast about a luminescence, revealing a narrow icy passageway that led downwards.  It was deathly cold, and our breaths condensed in clouds as we made our way down the wending tunnels.  My skin pricked, and all my senses seemed on edge.

But if we do meet again it shall be in a place that does not yet exist - the city of Angolwen.”  She raised an arm then and from it shot a tremendous pulse of arcane energy, the violet light shooting to the roof of the cavern and spearing through, deep through, till it split the rock apart right through to the open sky a mile above.  Sunlight spilled down, splashing over Linaniil’s lithe form.  It had been many hours since this long long night had begun.

“But for now, farewell Aranion,” she said as she began to float from the ground.  And then she sped up and soared out of sight.

I lay down on the cold stone, resting for a while, slowly healing my wounds and recovering my strength.  I reflected on the events since the evening before, thinking back on the trials of all the races of Maj’Eyal.  War, disease and death threatened all equally.  Was Linaniil beyond that now?  How would a taste of immortality affect her?

It was then that thought for our race came to me.  In ages past we had searched for immortality.  Our ancestral leaders had obsessed over it, but out of vanity, pride and a fear of death.  What would the real effects be if all our society were to be gifted with it?  With immortal life we might separate ourselves from the strifes and wars of the world.  It would give us a perspective beyond the petty squabbles and prideful competition of the other races.

I dug through the ice and rocks and found still some trace of the dead god Quekorja, faint though it were.  I gathered all that was left and made the long journey back to Elvala.  There I retreated to my labs, studying the remains for years before finally unlocking its secrets.  It was thus that immortality for our race was born, and it has changed our outlook on the world ever since.

We stood apart from the others then, not engaging in war, finding a new respect for life.  It was not till Garkul the Devourer assaulted our gates in the Age of Pyre that we ever had cause for large scale war again, and I rode out to face him in combat.

But ah, that is another tale, one indeed of many tales, in the long and rich history of the Tales of Maj’Eyal...]], "_t")

Have you cast away the feeble pretensions of your society? Does your soul thirst for the taste of real power? Do you wish to have the strength to deny that most prevalent force, death itself? The glorious art of necromancy shall fulfil your wishes in ways you couldn't possibly imagine.

#{italic}#1. Your First Steps#{normal}#

Be aware, necromancy isn't all weaving mighty spells of undeath, wearing flowing black robes and crushing entire nations beneath the feet of your mighty undead horde; you'll have to put in some elbow grease as well. Your first few bodies will have to be stolen away personally as few people will aid a necromancer willingly, and those that do are rarely competent. The cemeteries of small towns and villages are good sites for your first acquisitions, but if time demands it don't be afraid to "make" some specimens of your own with the aid of a sharp knife or heavy bludgeon. Once you have your first minions out performing your bidding you needn't worry about resources any longer; opportunities to practice your art will, quite literally, pile up.

Also important is the upkeep of the bodies themselves. True, this is not strictly necessary as sufficient enchantment can bestow mobility upon even the most ruined and incomplete remains, but making sure that the joints and cruses of your prospective minions move freely and with ease much reduces the will required to grant them reanimation. It also makes for a sturdy and reliable base in case you desire to undertake larger, more audacious projects (see 46. Bone Giants & You).

Sadly, it is not only the peasantry and our "virtuous" archmage cousins that disapprove of our work. Though not entirely understood, necromancy is known to create "ripples" of a sort across the many dimensions, ripples that attract extra-planar attention. As a necromancer's power grows, so do said ripples, until eventually said necromancer finds all manner of demonic force and entity beating down their door, both mentally and physically.

Once again, opinions differ on this demonic interference. Necromancy is such a beautiful, divergent art, is it not? The Tren? method sees the necromancer's corruption by outside forces as a negative thing, and practitioners of said method often take measures to divert supernatural attention from themselves, creating talismans to act as spiritual "conductors" or living close to the communities that despise them, the life essences of the masses masking the necromancer's dark emanations. On the other hand, the Beinagrind method welcomes the cursed whisperings that come from the demonic realms, believing it to be the completion of their psyches. Only once their spirits have been "corrupted" (a term Beinagrind practitioners scoff at) do people realize their true ambitions, they claim. Why these "true ambitions" always seem to be the utter and complete destruction of all life in this world and the summoning of unthinkable atrocities from the outer dimensions is unexplored.

t([[#{italic}#An undead hunter's guide, by Aslabor Borys#{normal}#

So, apparently I'm a legend now. Hah, knock a vampire's head off with a greatmaul and suddenly you're up there with Toknor and Mirvenia apparently. More and more often these days I get novice adventurers coming up to me, asking me for advice when it comes to battling the undead. My first instinct was to tell them to get back home and become bakers or gardeners or something. If they need crib notes for combat they obviously aren't cut out for it.

But then I was thinking, these are good kids. Heck, I'd buy every man and woman in the world who's bumped off a ghoul a free drink if I could. If they want help when it comes to putting down necromancer slime and their chilling creations, I would be more than happy to oblige. Not much of a writer, but let's see. First...

#{bold}#1. Ghouls#{normal}#

Every once in a while, people come to me and say "Are all necromancers truly evil?" "Surely necromancy could be used for good!" "Isn't it wrong to discriminate against others simply because of the magicks they practice?" To these people, the first thing I usually say - shortly after giving them a black eye - is to take a look at a ghoul. Take a good, long look. Take in the diseased, putrescent flesh. Take in the oozing, exposed organs. Take in its features, slowly rotting to mulch. It used to be a person. It used to have a family, people who loved it. Now it's a walking corpse, its only desire being death and the mad, all-encompassing consumption of living flesh. Are all necromancers truly evil? A thousand times, yes.

Even this most basic of undead minions can strike terror into the unprepared. The multitude of diseases that a normal ghoul carries are contagious in a manner many adventurers do not truly appreciate until they see the sores and necrosis visibly spreading up their arm from where a ghoul bit them. Such maladies must be dealt with promptly: if bitten by a ghoul, immediately plunge the afflicted area in scalding hot water, then wrap it quickly in clean cloth lined with mugwort and quartz powder. The wound must remain dressed for three weeks, with new dressings applied every four days, and make sure to burn the old ones! Failing the above, a wild infusion also works splendidly.

    * * *


#{bold}#2. Skeletons#{normal}#

What guide to the undead would be complete without mentioning the humble skeleton? Despite these clattering and chittering bones of the deceased often looking so fragile that a stiff breeze could break them apart, in many ways they are more dangerous than their ghoul cousins.

With no masses of rotted and ruined flesh to reanimate, necromancers can commit themselves fully to bestowing some level of fighting skill on a reanimated skeleton, and since a fighter's weapons will often last as long as his bones will, skeletons are usually armed and sometimes even armoured. The potential skill of a skeleton doesn't stop at melee weapons either - fallen archers take up their bows once again, and although difficult by comparison, some necromancers can even grant dead mages their magic powers once again.

Some adventurers find themselves baffled when it comes to fighting skeletons. How do you destroy a foe who, by all rights, should be destroyed already? To these adventurers, I say take heart. The more broken and incomplete a body is, the more effort it takes to keep it reanimated. As most necromancers see skeletons as the lowest of low peons, you can expect a few good blows to easily dissipate the minimal effort their masters put into creating them.

    * * *


#{bold}#3. Wights#{normal}#

Wights are an odd duck amongst the undead, often not created by necromancers specifically, but instead rising of their own volition when the conditions are right. Wights are by no means individual souls, but often part of a gestalt; when a particular land has seen enough bloodshed - battlefields, forest, crypts and graveyards - wights can be seen to rise en masse, a near-physical representation of the battles and turmoil the land has faced. Sadly, it is for this reason that necromancers often facilitate the creation of wights regardless, for no other study or profession causes so much blood or death.

Those who have had encounters with wights often describe them as indistinct skeletal figures, wrapped in flowing cloaks that become faded and incorporeal at their edges, while strange lights dance where their eyes should remain. Survivors tell of a peculiar sense of exhaustion when in close proximity to them, as though merely being close to these figments of death causes one's life force to sputter and fade. Regardless of this and their ghostly appearance however, it has been recorded that steel and strength of arms is yet enough to destroy them, or at least to erase them for the time being. It's just a shame that such battles are likely to simply create more of them in the long run...

    * * *


#{bold}#4. Vampires#{normal}#

Vampires are so far removed from other varieties of undead it seems almost unreal. What grants them their longevity? How do they retain such great intelligence? Beyond their sallow complexion and drawn features, why do they not decay and decompose as their ghoulish siblings do? The study of vampiric nature is one long list of unanswered questions, each new study adding yet more to the ever-growing pile.

As said before, a vampire's greatest strength is its resemblance to a living man, both in mind and body. Thanks to this, vampires are known for residing comparatively close to normal towns and villages far more than other undead. Some have even been known to keep their lairs within these communities themselves! Despite their resemblance however, there are many telltale signs of vampirism: Unnaturally pale skin, long and distinctive fangs, an aversion to sunlight, and much more besides. In an effort to avoid close inspection, some vampires are known to masquerade as men of wealth, often cloistering themselves in remote locations to discourage prying eyes.

But perhaps the most astonishing thing regarding vampires is their propensity for alliance and familial relationships. No other undead being even approaches matching the incomprehensible tangle of clans, broods, families and bloodkin that vampires create for themselves. It is for this reason that vampires often end up becoming rulers of lesser undead themselves, commanding them as a normal necromancer would. So, in turn, treat them as you would a necromancer - with cold steel.

    * * *


#{bold}#5. Spirits#{normal}#

During my travels, I have noticed that some communities in the wild no longer bury their deceased as is the norm in larger settlements. Some folk burn the corpses of their fallen, committing their ashes to the earth instead. When asked why they perform this peculiar practice, I always receive the same answer: Necromancers. Fearful of their dead rising up to slay them at the whims of delusional, murderous filth, they believe that with the burning of the dead, their spirits are forever beyond the reach of a necromancer's bony fingers.

Alas, this is not true. While fire may burn away a man's physical being, no flame can touch his spirit. Unfortunately, necromancers can. Bereft of both body and freedom, many souls are driven mad in the employ of necromancers, ceaselessly drifting through windswept crypts, harrying any unfortunate wanderers they encounter with a multitude of curses and hexes. Worst of all are those spirits who embrace their newfound purpose, causing them to grow in power at a frightening rate. No other being in Maj'Eyal is so obviously abhorrent to existence itself as these "dreads"; it is almost as though creation itself wants these beings gone from her world.

#{bold}#6. Bone Giants#{normal}#

One of the most horrific, vomit-inducing expressions of the necromancer's so-called "art" is the bone giant. Not content with merely profaning the bodies of singular souls, some ambitious necromancers work to bind the bodies of countless skeletons together, creating hideous engines of destruction that can stand many times higher than the height of a normal man.

It is a deadly mistake to liken these abominations to the golems alchemists and archmages employ. Wilful and fey as they are, normal mages often only craft golems for utility and their own protection, while necromancers create bone giants for the sole purpose of dealing death, and the only limit to their destructive capability is the necromancer's twisted imagination. Ever fought a snow giant? Imagine one with six arms and fingers like blades, wrought of sharpened ribs. Imagine one with countless skulls lining every inch of its wretched body, all screaming for your blood to be spilt as it thrashes spinal columns like whips from its disfigured hands! After facing one of these grotesque amalgamations, you'll be begging to go back to the Daikara to pick on simple, frost-rimed sub-men.

#{bold}#7. Liches#{normal}#

Hate made flesh. Evil made pure. Death incarnate. The culmination of a necromancer's work. Whatever you know liches as, I can tell you that they do not match the countless myths and legends that surround their terrible figures. They surpass them.

Once a powerful necromancer finally crosses the border between life and death, the abyssal power that they could only initially grasp in dribs and drabs becomes theirs to control totally. It is often said that unexpected quakes, crops failing, and the leaves simultaneously falling from the trees heralds the birth of a lich. Lords of the undead, liches can annihilate ghouls and skeletons, banish dreads with a glance, and reduce bone giants to powder within moments.

As to how to actually destroy one? Well, tell you what. If you manage to defeat one of these abominations, be a dear and write a guide for me, for I have absolutely, positively, no idea.

    * * *]], [[#{italic}#An undead hunter's guide, by Aslabor Borys#{normal}#

So, apparently I'm a legend now. Hah, knock a vampire's head off with a greatmaul and suddenly you're up there with Toknor and Mirvenia apparently. More and more often these days I get novice adventurers coming up to me, asking me for advice when it comes to battling the undead. My first instinct was to tell them to get back home and become bakers or gardeners or something. If they need crib notes for combat they obviously aren't cut out for it.

But then I was thinking, these are good kids. Heck, I'd buy every man and woman in the world who's bumped off a ghoul a free drink if I could. If they want help when it comes to putting down necromancer slime and their chilling creations, I would be more than happy to oblige. Not much of a writer, but let's see. First...

#{bold}#1. Ghouls#{normal}#

Every once in a while, people come to me and say "Are all necromancers truly evil?" "Surely necromancy could be used for good!" "Isn't it wrong to discriminate against others simply because of the magicks they practice?" To these people, the first thing I usually say - shortly after giving them a black eye - is to take a look at a ghoul. Take a good, long look. Take in the diseased, putrescent flesh. Take in the oozing, exposed organs. Take in its features, slowly rotting to mulch. It used to be a person. It used to have a family, people who loved it. Now it's a walking corpse, its only desire being death and the mad, all-encompassing consumption of living flesh. Are all necromancers truly evil? A thousand times, yes.

Even this most basic of undead minions can strike terror into the unprepared. The multitude of diseases that a normal ghoul carries are contagious in a manner many adventurers do not truly appreciate until they see the sores and necrosis visibly spreading up their arm from where a ghoul bit them. Such maladies must be dealt with promptly: if bitten by a ghoul, immediately plunge the afflicted area in scalding hot water, then wrap it quickly in clean cloth lined with mugwort and quartz powder. The wound must remain dressed for three weeks, with new dressings applied every four days, and make sure to burn the old ones! Failing the above, a wild infusion also works splendidly.

    * * *


#{bold}#2. Skeletons#{normal}#

What guide to the undead would be complete without mentioning the humble skeleton? Despite these clattering and chittering bones of the deceased often looking so fragile that a stiff breeze could break them apart, in many ways they are more dangerous than their ghoul cousins.

With no masses of rotted and ruined flesh to reanimate, necromancers can commit themselves fully to bestowing some level of fighting skill on a reanimated skeleton, and since a fighter's weapons will often last as long as his bones will, skeletons are usually armed and sometimes even armoured. The potential skill of a skeleton doesn't stop at melee weapons either - fallen archers take up their bows once again, and although difficult by comparison, some necromancers can even grant dead mages their magic powers once again.

Some adventurers find themselves baffled when it comes to fighting skeletons. How do you destroy a foe who, by all rights, should be destroyed already? To these adventurers, I say take heart. The more broken and incomplete a body is, the more effort it takes to keep it reanimated. As most necromancers see skeletons as the lowest of low peons, you can expect a few good blows to easily dissipate the minimal effort their masters put into creating them.

    * * *


#{bold}#3. Wights#{normal}#

Wights are an odd duck amongst the undead, often not created by necromancers specifically, but instead rising of their own volition when the conditions are right. Wights are by no means individual souls, but often part of a gestalt; when a particular land has seen enough bloodshed - battlefields, forest, crypts and graveyards - wights can be seen to rise en masse, a near-physical representation of the battles and turmoil the land has faced. Sadly, it is for this reason that necromancers often facilitate the creation of wights regardless, for no other study or profession causes so much blood or death.

Those who have had encounters with wights often describe them as indistinct skeletal figures, wrapped in flowing cloaks that become faded and incorporeal at their edges, while strange lights dance where their eyes should remain. Survivors tell of a peculiar sense of exhaustion when in close proximity to them, as though merely being close to these figments of death causes one's life force to sputter and fade. Regardless of this and their ghostly appearance however, it has been recorded that steel and strength of arms is yet enough to destroy them, or at least to erase them for the time being. It's just a shame that such battles are likely to simply create more of them in the long run...

    * * *


#{bold}#4. Vampires#{normal}#

Vampires are so far removed from other varieties of undead it seems almost unreal. What grants them their longevity? How do they retain such great intelligence? Beyond their sallow complexion and drawn features, why do they not decay and decompose as their ghoulish siblings do? The study of vampiric nature is one long list of unanswered questions, each new study adding yet more to the ever-growing pile.

As said before, a vampire's greatest strength is its resemblance to a living man, both in mind and body. Thanks to this, vampires are known for residing comparatively close to normal towns and villages far more than other undead. Some have even been known to keep their lairs within these communities themselves! Despite their resemblance however, there are many telltale signs of vampirism: Unnaturally pale skin, long and distinctive fangs, an aversion to sunlight, and much more besides. In an effort to avoid close inspection, some vampires are known to masquerade as men of wealth, often cloistering themselves in remote locations to discourage prying eyes.

But perhaps the most astonishing thing regarding vampires is their propensity for alliance and familial relationships. No other undead being even approaches matching the incomprehensible tangle of clans, broods, families and bloodkin that vampires create for themselves. It is for this reason that vampires often end up becoming rulers of lesser undead themselves, commanding them as a normal necromancer would. So, in turn, treat them as you would a necromancer - with cold steel.

    * * *


#{bold}#5. Spirits#{normal}#

During my travels, I have noticed that some communities in the wild no longer bury their deceased as is the norm in larger settlements. Some folk burn the corpses of their fallen, committing their ashes to the earth instead. When asked why they perform this peculiar practice, I always receive the same answer: Necromancers. Fearful of their dead rising up to slay them at the whims of delusional, murderous filth, they believe that with the burning of the dead, their spirits are forever beyond the reach of a necromancer's bony fingers.

Alas, this is not true. While fire may burn away a man's physical being, no flame can touch his spirit. Unfortunately, necromancers can. Bereft of both body and freedom, many souls are driven mad in the employ of necromancers, ceaselessly drifting through windswept crypts, harrying any unfortunate wanderers they encounter with a multitude of curses and hexes. Worst of all are those spirits who embrace their newfound purpose, causing them to grow in power at a frightening rate. No other being in Maj'Eyal is so obviously abhorrent to existence itself as these "dreads"; it is almost as though creation itself wants these beings gone from her world. It is my hope that you, and many others, oblige her wish.

One of the most horrific, vomit-inducing expressions of the necromancer's so-called "art" is the bone giant.

But Branzir ran after and ran swifter and nigh caught him before they reached the Woods of Darmin. There Ralkur assumed the form of a monkey and took to the trees. But Branzir tracked him and followed close, overcoming the traps his foe left behind. Then the forest fell away and they came to the Azure Sea, and Ralkur took the form of a gull and flew over the waters cawing with prideful glee. But Branzir was unfazed and leapt into the water, swimming after the cowardly god with all his strength. Twenty days and nights he followed through the ocean, feeding off fish he could catch near the surface, whilst Ralkur beat his wings on the winds above. Not once did Branzir lose sight of his target, and with each passing day Ralkur became more and more filled with fright.

Finally they came to the far shore of Tar'Eyal, and Ralkur fell onto the sandy beach bereft of strength. Depleted of all energy he reverted to his natural form, short and squat, and stumbled across the sand before falling down exhausted. Branzir arose from the water behind, and in spite of his trials he stood tall and fierce, and marched with purpose towards the cowering god. He drew out the fell blade Madrath from its sheath and held it to the throat of his prey.

But Ralkur, in a last desperate effort, took on a pathetic and piteous form, and wailing and crying he begged Branzir for mercy, promising to leave all Eyal and never return. And Branzir, looking on the divine form sunk to such depths, was moved in his heart, and agreed. But he said in a solemn tone, "Get thee then from this world, which we mortals now claim for our own. Remove thyself from all influence in Eyal, and never dare thee to return. But if thou doest break my trust, let thee be afeared. For then not a breath shalt thou take that it will not be a gasp, and not a step shalt thou take that it will not be in flight, and each beat of thy traitorous heart shalt be a pounding of terror. For I shalt come for thee and I shalt find thee and even to the depths of Infinity I shalt hunt thee without rest till my hands are on thy throat and thy life is crushed to dust." And when he spake the wind fell silent and the sky turned black, for when a Sher'Tul speaks so his words become Words of Power, and they can change the world forever. And Ralkur hearing those words was filled with a dread beyond conception, and forgetting all exhaustion he immediately took the form of a swallow and flew high into the sky beyond all sight.]], [[Thus began the greatest hunt there ever was. Branzir used forceful coercion and the spilling of blood to uncover the secret of his enemy's hiding place. He tracked Ralkur down to the primitive settlement where he had taken the form of one of the lesser races. Branzir rooted him out, and came upon him with Madrath in hand.

t([[Branzir returned to his people, and continued the hunt for the other gods, till but one god remained: Amakthel. Then the last great Godhunt began, as the Sher'Tul fought to overcome their maker and master. And this was no easy feat, for Amakthel was by far the strongest of all the gods, and many Sher'Tul were still loyal to their creator. Much blood was spilled before ever the assault on his throne could begin, and much blood would spill still after.

Now Ralkur had fled into the heavens with the full intent of passing beyond all reach of mortals forever more, such was the fear laid on him by the solemn words of Branzir. But as he soared higher and the fear faded, he came to change his mind, for he was a prideful god and moreso a vengeful one. Thoughts and schemes began to build in his mind for how he could gain retribution on the Sher'Tul that had brought him to shame. So he took on the form of an eagle and flew above the highest volcano in Eyal, and there he stretched his wings and glided high on the rising heat, watching all that happened in the lands below and biding his time for vengeance.

He watched with joy as he saw the Sher'Tul armies fall before the forces of Amakthel's fortress. He watched with anxiety as he saw the Sher'Tul finally break through the defences and come upon the great god himself. He watched with awe as he saw the nine Godslayers do battle with their creator, and several broken before his almighty wrath. And then he watched with utter terror as he saw the mightiest of all gods felled, and maimed and mutilated and bound, and cast into the darkest depths of the world.

t([[Seeing the full powers of the Sher'Tul Ralkur felt paralysed with fear, and thought his quest for vengeance hopeless. But he bided his time still, and his patience was rewarded as he saw dissention begin to arise in the great race. When Caldizar disappeared and the Godslayers separated he felt his time was ripe, and he came upon the forest keep of Branzir under a storm of wrath. He flew down screeching, and spreading his wings he let loose spikes of steel that rained down on the keep, cutting through wood and stone and flesh. All who were in the keep were killed, and the air was filled with Ralkur's cackling laughter as he flew away.

But the vengeful god had been hasty at the last, for Branzir was out hunting at the time. Coming back the next day he saw his home in ruins, and all his family and servants butchered, and sorrow and torment filled every corner of his being. On hearing reports of what happened he knew well the perpetrator and his fury was incandescent. He sought the aid of the other Godhunters in scouring out the stray god, but they were all divided, and each engaged in the politics that would lay the seeds for war. Perhaps if they had aided him then the popular Branzir could have helped unify the people and stop the madness that was to come. But Caldizar was gone, reportedly aggrieved and repentant at their acts, and the remaining Godslayers thought only of their own powers and making gods of themselves.]], [[Seeing the full powers of the Sher'Tul Ralkur felt paralysed with fear, and thought his quest for vengeance hopeless.

Ralkur fled at the sight of Branzir and his dark blade, filled with all-encompassing fright. But Branzir was not to be lost, and chased him into some nearby ruins.

The rumours you have heard are true. It is with a heavy heart that I confirm one of our mines, Reknor, has been overtaken and inhabited by a large and organised orcish force.

A battalion of soldiers will form a defensive perimeter around Reknor until a force to retake the mine and exterminate the orcs can be mustered. All civilians residing within the surrounding halls are to be evacuated.

This is a grave and unprecedented issue, so I decree an oath of silence to be laid upon all citizens of the Iron Throne, regardless of class and station: NO NEWS OF THIS INVASION MUST REACH FOREIGN EARS. We must maintain an image of stability and strength with the Allied Kingdom, as any signs of weakness or internal strife would be catastrophic to our alliance and future trade agreements. Any citizen found divulging this information to any outside party will be punished with exile. Rest assured, I will personally send messages to those outside the Throne who can be trusted with this information, and I trust this orcish intrusion shall be dealt with swiftly and decisively.

I'm not cut out for this paladin work. Here I am, alone in a horrible dark dungeon in an unknown land, without a single sound to keep me company beyond the scratchings of my own quill. Hmm, except for--]], "_t")

The orcish tribe have routed us. We have retreated to some Mardrop ruins and secured ourselves amongst the fortifications. I have just shy of 2,000 men under my banner, some of the best warriors I have ever served with, but we are simply no match for the numbers we face. Counting them is difficult, but I would put a minimum estimate at 10,000. The tribe has camped a league away - they seem to be waiting for reinforcements. This does not bode well...

Five men tried deserting last night. Today I had them flogged in front of all the others. I have given warning that any future deserters shall be hanged. These are measures I do not like to take, but harsh times call for harsher discipline.

Our supplies are holding steady for now, but I fear they may not last. I've received word that it will take at least fifty days to muster a force that can save us. Alas, food may well be the least of our worries, for the orcs have begun to attack our strongholds. Thankfully we have had time to reinforce the existing structures. Indeed, little work was needed, for the foundations of this place are strong. My loremaster tells me it was abandoned following the Crimson Pox, but was once the capital of Mardrop. The men have taken a fondness to the place, and have named it "Last Hope". Though I normally discourage such romantic notions I cannot help but feel the same. These stone walls give strength to my heart - I feel we can fight through this.

Rations low. Men demoralised. Winterhaze wind is making conditions unbearable. The fortress is holding, but each night they pick off some of our troops. It is but a matter of time before we no longer have the strength to resist.

I can hear their blasted trumpets again. Accursed swine! We have no rest or sleep, not the slightest sojourn without their braying, howling, jeering, taunting, insufferable cantations! It is driving me from my wits! But I must remain strong... I must put on a brave face for the men. They are relying on me, and though the burden feels close to crushing me I must bear it with the dignity of a king.

Oh, happy days! Joyous retribution! From the jaws of defeat we have been saved, and never before have I felt such elation!

Last night as dusk approached, the orcish armies began to prepare a major attack. My men were ready, for I was determined that if they were to have our lives they would pay for them thrice over. But as the sun waned in the western sky I saw what looked like a rain of gold falling amongst the orcish troops and suddenly they were in disarray. Another flurry came and I saw that it were not gold, but bolts of steel reflected in the setting sun. "The halflings!" my scout shouted, and lo I saw then it was indeed a large army of halflings come upon the orcs' flank.

The orcish army suddenly forgot about us, turning upon their new enemy. But foolish is any who ignores the wrath of a caged lion which sees its chance for vengeance! I led my men immediately into battle, taking the enemy swiftly from the rear, and throwing their organisation into madness. When the halfling army came upon their flank it was a massacre, and we drove them mercilessly towards the southern lake. There upon the shores we beat them to the last number, and their blood stained the water a horrific black.

Our victory sealed, I immediately met with the halfling leader, and found it to be no less than the princess Mirvenia! Truly words cannot express my joy when I saw her face flushed red in the last embers of the setting sun. I almost felt... no, I should not think such things.]], [[#{italic}#51st of Haze, Year of Pyre 710#{normal}#

We have solidified the defences at Last Hope and received more troops from all of the kingdoms. Our tactical position near the sea is proving an excellent base for further attacks on the orcs. I hope to expand our facilities here much further. I am drawing up an alliance now with the other leaders, for only together can we hope to beat this terrible threat to all our kingdoms.

Mirvenia has been key to the discussions and the plans. She is a tactical genius, and I am constantly amazed by her wealth of knowledge and skills. There is an odd woman that accompanies her though, with long fiery hair and a silken robe - Linaniil is her name. One of my men swears he saw her riding into battle in a blaze of flames, burning all the orcs before her. The idea of a spellweaver in our midst is unsettling, but Mirvenia says I should trust her. And if Mirvenia says so then I must believe her.

She is a remarkable force for good, Mirvenia, popular with all the troops. I feel my normal iron rule smoothed by her presence. Too long have I led the cold life of a soldier... alone...

Ah, the beating of my heart cannot be silenced. I must speak to Mirvenia, and tell her how I feel... I only hope she shares some inkling of my emotion.]], [[#{italic}#2nd of Allure, Year of Pyre 711#{normal}#

Why is it only in times of darkness I turn to my journal? Today has been the darkest day in over two years, but it could have been darker still.

Mirvenia's convoy was attacked by a rogue band of orcs. Though the brutes were repelled she was hurt in the conflict, and her labour brought on early. She lay before the halls of death for many hours. It is only thanks to the skill of her people's healers that she and the baby survived.

The baby... our baby. My son! Mirvenia is still recovering, but the boy seems hale as any freshly-born child. But still I worry... How I wish that he were born into a more perfect world. How I worry for my wife and child in this age of suffering. I want to make a new age for them, free from such threats as almost took away the woman I love. I want to give my son the chance to reign in an era of peace.

Too long have we been content with repelling orcish raids and pushing back small tribes. Last Hope is now a gleaming city, and a focal point for all the armies of the west. Now is the time for us to drive forward and root out every orcish colony on the continent. I will not rest until Maj'Eyal is free from their vile influence, till every accursed brood is burned to ashes and every pig-spawn orc is cast from existence. I shall end this terrible Age of Pyre and usher in a new Age of Ascendancy! This I do solemnly swear.]], [[#{italic}#6th of Flare, Year of Pyre 713#{normal}#

t([[#{italic}#A study into Southspar's most unusual ruler.#{normal}#

Chances are you haven't heard of Southspar.

And why would you have? It was naught but a tiny, provincial island kingdom off the coast of Tar'Eyal that existed within the Ages of Allure and Dusk. By all accounts, Southspar was a pleasant place to live; temperate climate, healthy trade relations with mainland human kingdoms, and by great luck, the island upon which the kingdom sat held great deposits of the much-valued metal stralite.

Despite this good fortune though, Southspar was doomed to mediocrity. Why? The actions of its ruler. By all accounts a bumbling, octogenarian dotard, his name lost to the mists of time, this mouldy monarch mismanaged Southspar almost to its demise. The Dwarves of the Iron Throne, having heard of the stralite beneath the island, manipulated the king into mining it and selling it to them for a fraction of its true worth. Also, despite Southspar's decidedly puny military power, the king saw fit to send whatever troops he could muster to aid mainland human kingdoms in their great and many wars against the halflings, who up to this point had barely registered Southspar's existence. Not only were the undertrained, ill-equipped troops crushed like vermin before the superior halfling forces, but also these foolhardy attacks succeeded in attracting the halflings' attention to their secluded island. Almost immediately, the raids began.

From what records remain, the king was mystified by the decline of his nation, believing to the end that every action he took had been the right one. He passed away soon after the halfling raids began. Whether it was suicide, assassination, or simple old age is unknown. The king never married and had no children, the only remaining member of his family being a distant cousin, a young man named Drake.

And so it was that Drake ascended to the throne, and Southspar entered a golden age.

#{bold}#1. Drake and the Halfling Horde.#{normal}#

To the newly crowned Drake, the most obvious and immediate threat to Southspar was the growing raids and sorties being held by the halflings. To this end, he ordered a complete and total reconstruction of Southspar's military, turning them from a ragtag bunch of militia into a small yet devastatingly efficient engine of war. Drake knew that the only advantage his forces held over the halflings was their knowledge of the island, and so bade them to travel stealthily, carry small, armour-defeating stralite knives rather than spears and swords, and only engage with the halflings strictly on their own terms. Southspar's newly assembled "Army of Rogues" was a success. Although the halflings were great in number, strike after surgical strike from Drake's army weighed heavily on their morale, and finally, grumpily declaring Southspar "not worth the bother", the halfling forces withdrew.

Southspar celebrated its peace and its newly found military might, but for Drake, the celebration was short-lived. The stralite he had used to craft his Army of Rogues' knives and armour was stralite that wasn't going into the Dwarves' pockets, and they were far from happy. Drake formulated a plan - by the time he was through, the Dwarves would be even further from happy.

#{bold}#2. Drake and the Stralite Stratagem.#{normal}#

The Dwarves have always been a secretive race. Even now only a select few know the location of their "Iron Council", and in the days of Southspar there were still those who considered Dwarves nothing but myth. Being a monarch in possession of large amounts of stralite can open even the most concealed of doors, however... Drake had requested an audience with the Iron Council, and the Dwarves, expecting said audience to be a humble apology and promises of further stralite for the gold they were paying, readily accepted.

What they got, in reality, was quite different. Gone was the ineffectual king of Southspar's past, and now the Dwarves found themselves facing a young, hard-eyed human who was demanding that the amount of gold that the Dwarves were paying for Southspar's stralite be increased twenty-fold.

To say the Dwarves scoffed at this would be an understatement; open, derisive laughter hits nearer the mark. Despite Southspar's recent repulsion of the halflings, the Dwarves of the Iron Throne saw no problem in taking Southspar's stralite by force. In his heart, Drake knew they could accomplish this, and it was to this end that he had brought the small pouch around his neck to the Council.

Drake held the small, drakeskin pouch high, opened it and emptied its contents onto the floor: Stralite, ground to dust, muddied with dirt and base metals, made unusable and worthless. The Dwarves of the Council gasped in horror at this waste, one (if rumours are to be believed) even fainting on the spot. Drake went on to say that, if his demands were not met, the entirety of the stralite beneath his island would meet the same fate as the stralite cast upon the chamber's floor.

By the time Drake left the Iron Council, the Dwarves had agreed to pay thirty times the previous amount.

t([[#{bold}#3. Drake and the Conclave Mages.#{normal}#

With its borders unassailed, ands its coffers rapidly filling with Dwarven gold, many believed that the fortune of Southspar could not increase any further. Drake, however, had one last task to accomplish, and it regarded the Conclave.

For a long time, a small number of Conclave mages had made their home in Southspar. The remote location and the doddering nature of its old king meant that they could perform experiments and practice magic that would have been disallowed on the mainland. Being reclusive by nature, only a few of their group had heard of the rise of the new king, and none of them had cared much. Drake's royal guards breaking down the door of their study, followed by the king himself, gave them cause to care. Drake had for them an ultimatum:

"This is the kingdom of Southspar, my kingdom, and so everything within her borders must be within my control. This applies to her people, her land, her resources, and now her magic. I shall allow you to remain here in Southspar on one condition: You become members of my royal court, obey my commands, and use your magic for the betterment of the kingdom. When un-needed you may tend to your Conclave matters as you will, but your greatest loyalty will be to me. Do you accept?"

The Conclave mages' response? Laughter. But this laughter was not the mocking laughter of the Dwarves, but laughter of disbelief. As recorded, the mages' response went as:

"King Drake! You needn't have bothered us with such a stern ultimatum! A simple request would have sufficed. True, in the past we may have chosen to reside here for simple seclusion, but it is hard to ignore Southspar's rising star. This kingdom's glory shall continue to grow, and we want to be a part of it. We accept."

Freedom from halfling attacks, Dwarven fortunes, and now the magic of the Conclave blessed Southspar. What, the common people thought, could possibly happen next?

Mere weeks after the Conclave joined the royal court, Drake fell ill and died.

#{bold}#4. Drake and the Empty Throne.#{normal}#

Drake was dead, and Southspar's people were struck with depression and outright horror. Their king, who was fast on his way to making their kingdom one of the greatest in Maj'Eyal, was no more. The throne lay empty; not a single soul vied for the now vacant position of king. As far as Southspar's citizens were concerned, it was Drake's throne, nobody else's.

The norm in tales like this would be that the kingdom slowly managed to get back on its feet, recover from the loss of their king, and finally return to a state resembling normalcy. Not so for Southspar. Drake's demise had left a wound that was not healing, and it was clear that something had to be done. One of the men closest to Drake in his life, his chancellor, left abruptly on a mysterious "errand", hoping that the kingdom would not crumble before his return. After a period of some months he did return, and his first port of call? The study of the Conclave mages. He held in his hand a tome, bound in skin and marked with blood-red runes. Its subject matter was obvious: Necromancy. The chancellor had but one command for the mages:

"Bring him back."

#{bold}#5. Drake and the Pale Kingdom.#{normal}#

Here, sadly, definitive facts on Southspar and Drake's fate vanish. Some say that Drake's rebirth was a resounding success, and Southspar's star continued to rise as the now skeletal Drake retook the throne, the gaze from his exposed skull unchanged from his mortal visage. Others believe that the madness that grasps those returned from the grave took him, and with the new powers that the Conclave had blessed him with began a reign of terror that drowned Southspar in blood. The only fact that can be known for certain was the new name his subjects gave to him in his death: Pale King Drake, the Pale King, or simply Pale Drake.

I leave you with a copy of one of the last pieces of Southspar's history, a partially destroyed scrap of parchment, supposedly written moments before the Cataclysm and Southspar's destruction, falling beneath the waves along with the rest of Tar'Eyal.

I shall allow you to remain here in Southspar on one condition: You become members of my royal court, obey my commands, and use your magic for the betterment of the kingdom. When un-needed you may tend to your Conclave matters as you will, but your greatest loyalty will be to me. Do you accept?"

The Conclave mages' response? Laughter. But this laughter was not the mocking laughter of the Dwarves, but laughter of disbelief. As recorded, the mages' response went as:

"King Drake! You needn't have bothered us with such a stern ultimatum! A simple request would have sufficed. True, in the past we may have chosen to reside here for simple seclusion, but it is hard to ignore Southspar's rising star. This kingdom's glory shall continue to grow, and we want to be a part of it. We accept."

Freedom from halfling attacks, Dwarven fortunes, and now the magic of the Conclave blessed Southspar. What, the common people thought, could possibly happen next?

Mere weeks after the Conclave joined the royal court, Drake fell ill and died.

#{bold}#4. Drake and the Empty Throne.#{normal}#

Drake was dead, and Southspar's people were struck with depression and outright horror. Their king, who was fast on his way to making their kingdom one of the greatest in Maj'Eyal, was no more. The throne lay empty; not a single soul vied for the now vacant position of king. As far as Southspar's citizens were concerned, it was Drake's throne, nobody else's.

The norm in tales like this would be that the kingdom slowly managed to get back on its feet, recover from the loss of their king, and finally return to a state resembling normalcy. Not so for Southspar. Drake's demise had left a wound that was not healing, and it was clear that something had to be done. One of the men closest to Drake in his life, his chancellor, left abruptly on a mysterious "errand", hoping that the kingdom would not crumble before his return. After a period of some months he did return, and his first port of call? The study of the Conclave mages. He held in his hand a tome, bound in skin and marked with blood-red runes. Its subject matter was obvious: Necromancy. The chancellor had but one command for the mages:

"Bring him back."

#{bold}#5. Drake and the Pale Kingdom.#{normal}#

Here, sadly, definitive facts on Southspar and Drake's fate vanish. Some say that Drake's rebirth was a resounding success, and Southspar's star continued to rise as the now skeletal Drake retook the throne, the gaze from his exposed skull unchanged from his mortal visage. Others believe that the madness that grasps those returned from the grave took him, and with the new powers that the Conclave had blessed him with began a reign of terror that drowned Southspar in blood. The only fact that can be known for certain was the new name his subjects gave to him in his death: Pale King Drake, the Pale King, or simply Pale Drake.

I leave you with a copy of one of the last pieces of Southspar's history, a partially destroyed scrap of parchment, supposedly written moments before the Cataclysm and Southspar's destruction, falling beneath the waves along with the rest of Tar'Eyal.

As of the 1st of Allure, Age of Pyre year 714, henceforth to be known as the Age of Ascendancy year 1, all human and halfling kingdoms shall be united under the banner of the Allied Kingdoms. This shall include all towns, villages, serfdoms and farmsteads with over 50% human or halfling populace in the whole expanse of Maj'Eyal.

The Allied Kingdoms shall be presided over by the rule of King Toknor and Queen Mirvenia, long may their line endure. Their throne and residency shall be held in the citadel of Last Hope, and here also shall be seated all administrative and military offices. Free trade shall be established between all elements of the Allied Kingdoms, and central taxation shall be administered by the Royal Treasury. All lands within the Allied Kingdoms shall be regularly patrolled by official guards to enforce the peace. One rule and one law shall be applied to all.

This unification shall make our lands stronger, more whole. Too long have we suffered under the shadows of invasion and terror. Too long have we been splintered, broken by petty infighting. But now we shirk off the failures of the past, and with one strong rule, one unbreakable alliance, we shall all prosper and find peace. Together we shall fight back against the darkness, and an age of light shall be born. We will fear the night no more.

To those who oppose this, let thee be afeared, for a new dawn is rising and it shall suffer no obstruction. This Alliance and the era it brings shall be protected at all costs. Treason will not be tolerated, and divisors will be damned. All shall follow the rule of Toknor and Mirvenia, or face the righteous wrath of a new age.

t([[The Oceans of Eyal represent a frontier which we have been powerless to break. In spite of advanced craft and skill, and even the more forbidden areas of magic, there are natural barriers that we simply cannot overcome. Long range seafaring has become seen as unprofitable and a fruitless endeavour. The last great ship to be built was the Vanguard, over a thousand years ago, which disappeared over the eastern horizon and was never seen again.

Yet we know that the Sher’Tul once travelled the whole globe, that records exist from our younger days of other continents, of sailing routes that go right round the whole of Eyal. How it stirs my heart to think of the unexplored lands that lie beyond our stormy coasts!

Alas, records from the time of the Spellblaze and the Cataclysm show that those old routes can no longer be traversed. A reshaping of currents, an increase in storms and a greater abundance of dangerous sea creatures have all locked us onto the continent of Maj’Eyal.

Yet my desire for knowledge is not sated. I spoke some time ago with an old fisherman - a halfling sea dog with a crusty beard, hideous scars, and the foul stench of stale ale all about him. Inbetween the wretched smelling breaths from his toothless mouth he told me some valuable information. I transcribe it as best I can here:

“Nay, ya’ll not get long out b’ond coast thar. In th’orth ya’ll run inta ice floes, miles wide stretches at’ll close in on ya and crush yar hull fro’neath. Out west be a field o’ storms, cyclones and hur’canes tha’ll swaller up any ‘at go near. And out east... ack, out east be th’orst. Nagas and sea dragons, switchin’ currents and ocean rifts, storms of hate like y’never seen in yar worst nightmares. As fer south, well tha’s best spot fer fishin’ and the like, we gots some good patches thar. But venture too far and ya meet a... I ‘unno, some magicy barrier or whatnot. Ships hit ‘gainst it like a wall o’ air. Go too fast and ya smash yar prow apart! And out b’ond it... some cloud of darkness lies on t’rizon. We stays clear o’ that, I tells ya.”

It’s a remarkable report, and one I’m minded to believe, in spite of the notorious unreliability of seafarer tales. South was once the continent of Tar’Eyal, said to be a desert-smothered land full of wild energies. What fate has swallowed it from our access now is hard to say. But my curiosity is sorely piqued, and I shall endeavour to charter a ship to investigate this strange barrier to the south. Likely the lesser races that crew these vessels would balk at such an enterprise, but I’m sure that with the leadership and influence of a Higher like myself I can persuade them to have a little more backbone.

t([[Dear diary,

Lessons are off this week as my tutor has fallen ill, so I've decided to sneak out and have a wander round the old mazed ruins nearby. I know I'll get in trouble if I'm caught, but as long as I'm back in a couple of days no one will notice... Besides, I get so bored cooped up in those mountains! I want some fun!

This is rather a dirty place though. I've come across a few bandits and snakes in here, but nothing to threaten a grade 3 mage like me.

I remember hearing that this labyrinth used to be a prison used by the halfling king Roupar during the Age of Dusk, and that with the lawlessness of the time captives were simply sent here to rot. Some say a magical curse infected the place and turned them into bull-like monsters that patrol the halls to this day. How exciting!!

With ease of use comes ease of mind and a weakening of one's will and concentration. Soon one will find oneself in a situation of risk, bereft of normal judgement of danger, and low on the mental resources to save onself. Heed thee well." Bah, what tosh!!!

t([[I have now devised the perfect trap for the horned beast that walks these halls! Truly he cannot avoid this amazing contraption - the perfect blend of technical mastery and nature's lethal gifts. Ah, how I look forward to having that monster's head mounted on my walls - it shall be the pride of my collection!

The contraption is elegant and simple, though many months I have spent getting the formula perfect. There are two vials attached together - one containing finely ground hemlock, the other containing a carefully prepared zinc compound. When the vials are broken the materials react with the air and pump out an amazing cloud of poisonous vapour! The poison is supremely effective, killing within minutes. All I have to do is carefully hide the vials beneath a thin piece of slate and wait for my prey to step upon the trap - then POOF, it's dead!

I have prepared a great many vials to last me throughout the hunting season. By this time next year I will have a trophy collection to match the kings!

I seem to have misplaced one though... I'm sure it must be close by.

t([[Many are the tales of how our world was made, from the absurd to the romantic to the horrific. But they are all mere myths, with no more than seeds of truth to even the most reliable. The history of our race goes back far, but it is tantalisingly scant in details from before we met the other races. Indeed, it is only through our battles with the others that we halflings have any ancient records at all.

The elves one would suspect of having the greatest knowledge of elder times, but they are aloof and silent. One must judge from this that either they do not know, or that the truth ashames them. The latter would certainly not surprise me.

The humans have more myths than they have brain cells. It seems that each village has several versions of their own local tales, usually passed down orally over the ages. It is clear that not a single element of any of their myths can be construed to contain any essence of the truth.

The dwarves are reticent about the subject of how they were made. They say that such talk is "not profitable". However upon further pressing (and bribing) they will open up a little further. They as a race are of the most fervent belief that they were the last people to be made in Maj'Eyal. They say they are the "final product". Their word for all other races in fact translates directly to "prototype". This mostly singular outlook does of course seem absurd, but one need only look at the rest of dwarven society to see that they are an absurd race with ridiculous ideals. If they are what they consider perfection then I thank whatever god made me that I am flawed!

The subject of gods is of course a difficult one. Clearly there are no divine forces at work in the world today. But the world as we know it did not come from nothing, and even the great Sher'Tul clearly did naught more than manipulate the world - they did not make it.

By logical conjecture one can only presume that some great being made the world. This must have been a benevolent being, for it is clear that "He" created creatures separate from himself to walk the earth. Clearly this is we halflings. We are the only race that truly appreciates the world. We do not warp it with magic experiments like the Shaloren, nor hide from it like the Thaloren. We do not bring destruction like the orcs, or petty greed like the dwarves. And our understanding and knowledge is so far advanced than the humans that it is hard to understand why we share the same world with them at all. We were quite clearly the first of the current races to be created, and our natural feelings of entitlement to all there is in Maj'Eyal must stem from this.

Now that this has been clearly analysed in logical terms, one must consider the source of the other races. It is impossible that they were made by the same god - truly impossible. What strange being could create our race, so gifted and rounded, and yet make such warped and twisted creatures as the dwarves and humans? No, clearly other gods were responsible, lesser gods than our own which copied his grand design. But with fudging fingers and inelegant touches the works of their design were clearly far inferior to the subtleties and perfection which crafted us.

However there remains the matter of the Sher'Tul. Clearly these were of greater power than us, and yet they disappeared. One must presume that our god made this race before us, but was somehow unhappy with them, and so removed them and made us instead. We are not as powerful as the Sher'Tul - not yet at least - but we have our own gifts that evidently give us a greater place in our creator's heart. This would explain why we were the first race to unlock the powers of the Sher'Tul farportals. We had a natural affinity to the works of our elder brethren.

So what happened to these gods after they had made the races which we see today? One must presume strife between them, and that they killed themselves, or took their battle away from the world. Our creator, seeing the other gods killed or left, must have then entrusted the world to us halflings, knowing that we would rule over it in his stead. This is why at every point in history we have played a pivotal role in the shaping of our world.

t([[I begin my writings with a study of the humans, currently the most populous of the races in Maj'Eyal. The greatest kingdom in number are by far the Cornacs, but mention should also be made of the Sholtar and Mardrop kingdoms, and the Higher bloodline. The biggest human population centre is around the citadel of Last Hope, though many other settlements exist across all corners of Maj'Eyal.

Cornacs are normally around 5'9", with generally dark hair, brown eyes and ruddy features. Most Cornacs take up roles as tradesmen, farmers, or other manual labour jobs. It is a sad fact that the majority of bandit groups tend to be dominated by Cornacs. Cornac families tend to be large, and since the Age of Dusk their population has expanded rapidly, especially in the farming lands in the west and around Last Hope in the south.

Sholtar are generally 5'11", with dark skin, hair and eyes. They originate from the south-east of Maj'Eyal, and are few in number since the Cataclysm tore much of their land into the sea. Their affinity with nature is renowned, and they are often found employed as healers, infusion crafters or wyrmic huntsmen.

Mardrop humans are all but extinct, after the Spellhunt and the plagues during the Age of Dusk. They were known to be powerful spellcasters, and as such were prime targets by the spellhunters. However some trace of them can still be found, as their fiery hair and freckled skin oft can appear in those of distant descent. A few are rumoured to still possess citadels and towers in remote locations.

Highers are on average 6'0", with fair hair and skin and blue or grey eyes. The majority of scholarly roles are taken up by Highers, and they tend to fill most of the noble classes. Some say this is due to discrimination and elitism, though these may simply be jealous sentiments. There are also rumours that the superior intellects of Highers are due to arcane experiments instigated by the ancient Conclave during the Age of Allure, but I have found no records to support this idea and must consider it to be baseless. The Higher bloodline is renowned as a mark of excellence, and mixing with lower bloods is strongly frowned upon.

All human kingdoms were united by King Toknor the Brave in the Age of Pyre, and remain under the rule of his son King Tolak the Fair.

t([[There are two main kingdoms of halflings, the Eldoral and the Nargol, though both mix often. All halflings are just under 4' tall, and are generally noted for their large feet and curly hair. Eldoral are usually fair-haired and blue-eyed. Nargol tend to be darker in hair and complexion, with hazel eyes, and oft slightly shorter than their cousins. Halflings are known for their intelligence and quick wit, but also their arrogance in dealing with other races - something they do not deny, for they say it is well-deserved.

Halflings used to be the most dominant race in Maj'Eyal, with control of many strategic Sher'Tul ruins and rule over great swathes of land. The recorded wars between humans and halflings are numerous, and the halflings were the most often victors. However the Age of Pyre brought them great ruin, for the orcs seemed to target them more fiercely than any other race, and many of their communities were wiped out. This has forced them to rely more on trade with other races in modern times, especially with the humans.

The Eldorals used to have a kingdom in the north of the continent, but most of it was destroyed during the wars with the orcs, and not much has been rebuilt. However they do still have many agricultural settlements such as Derth, albeit shared with other races. The Eldoral are known for their great healers and farmers, and their slingers are considered the best in all the lands.

The Nargols once had many strong fortifications in the south of Maj'Eyal, but though they suffered less than the Eldoral in the Age of Pyre they still lost great numbers, and much of their centres of population dwindled. The rise of Last Hope has accelerated this process, as many communities are subsumed into the city's suburbs. Nargols are known as great jewellers, alchemists and rune-crafters, and possess some of the best tactical minds of all the races. Many generals and military advisers are employed from their kingdom.

The most famous of all halflings is Queen Mirvenia, most famed for her saving of King Toknor in Last Hope from a siege of orcs. Mystery still surrounds how she managed to bypass the winter's icy floes with her army to reach the citadel in time to rescue Toknor. Some have hypothesised that she enlisted the aid of sorcerers, but none of her troops would talk about the journey afterwards. She wed King Toknor in the second year of the Age of Ascendancy, and gave birth to the first known mixed race child - Tolak the Fair.

t([[The dwarves are an exceptionally secretive and quiet race, reluctant to talk about themselves to outsiders unless hefty bribes are paid. Many times in their history they have cut off all contact with the other races for no known reason, shutting tight the great iron doors that cover the trade passages to their mines and their cavernous cities. However of late they have become more open with the outside world, and I have even had the pleasure of receiving the unique distinction of being allowed to enter their main city, the Iron Throne, and speaking with several of their guild leaders.

Dwarves are around 5' tall, with generally brown or grey hair. They are usually stocky and muscular, and known to be very resistant to any physical suffering. Their females can be hard to distinguish from their males, but can usually be identified by the beads braided into their beards. All dwarves are highly proud of their beards, and take immaculate care of them. The greatest insult to a dwarf is to belittle his beard, and the greatest sign of suffering in a dwarf is for him to tear at his beard.

Dwarves are known especially for their smithwork and artificing, which is unrivalled amongst all the other races. They also make cunning merchants, known to drive a hard bargain. Their society consists of a fairly strict caste system, with families belonging to guilds of miners, smelters, craftsmen, and so on, and deviance into work outside of one's guild of birth is almost unheard of. However there is no perceived inequality between guilds, with each having equal representation on their ruling Committee of Guilds. Who actually acts as figurehead is unknown to outsiders though, and no amount of bribing will encourage any dwarf to speak on the subject. When it is mentioned in passing their allusions to a leader are normally marked by an almost religious reverence.

Their skill with metal is renowned above all else. Dwarven steel is considered the most durable material for use in construction, and dwarves are the finest workers with stralite and voratun, precious metals of immense value. They trade heavily in their crafts from their capital the Iron Throne, but allow no outsiders in - instead they send innumerable merchant caravans out to all the cities to ply their wares.

As well as the many merchant dwarves one may meet there are also a great deal of young dwarves who venture beyond their halls of stone. These are generally of adventuring fare, and it is encouraged in dwarven society to experience something of the wider world in one's younger years. This is known to them as being "smithed upon the anvil of the world". In private though some senior dwarves admit that this activity is promoted to help with their "market research strategy".]], [[The dwarves are an exceptionally secretive and quiet race, reluctant to talk about themselves to outsiders unless hefty bribes are paid.

Though other races shun the dangers of magic to a large degree, the Shaloren embrace it, and it is still widely used throughout their society. However they are careful to hide this in their dealings with other races. The Shaloren were the ones that began the Spellblaze, though they would soon have it forgotten, and the memories of blame run deep amongst many.

t([[The Naloren (or Nalore - lit "siblings of spirit") are now an extinct race, as their homeland was swept into the sea by the Cataclysm. However as a separate elf race they are worth studying, scant though the records be. Much of what is now said about the Naloren is traced with myth, but one can deduce certain facts.

Naloren elves were around 5'10", with blonde hair and green eyes. They were incredibly thin, but known for their swift and dextrous capabilities. Their kingdom was located on the eastern side of Maj'Eyal, and all of their towns were on the sea or straddling major rivers. They employed themselves as fishermen, sponge-divers, sailors and musicians. They were renowned for being able to stay underwater for hours at a time, and those with arcane abilities were said to be able to stay submerged indefinitely.

The Shaloren were in particular keen to study this relic, but the Naloren always refused them access, though they were too afraid to touch it themselves. The orcs were said to encroach on their lands often, but were always fought back by their mail-clad warriors wielding vicious tridents.

Alas their love of the sea was to be their undoing. When the Cataclysm came the whole of the coastal kingdom was shorn away and fell into the sea, annihilating almost the entire race.

t("Loremaster Greynot's Analysis of the Races - Chapter 7 - Ogres", "Loremaster Greynot's Analysis of the Races - Chapter 7 - Ogres", "_t")
t([[Ogres have never been a thriving race, starting from their abrupt appearance as soldiers and laborers for the Conclave during the Allure Wars (unexplained aside from a highly implausible story from the Conclave's Overseers about a lost mountain tribe).  Left without homes or proper runic training after the war's end, they were forced to found their own tribes and rediscover the fields of rune and infusion creation for themselves, and though their numbers dropped rapidly, they enjoyed a brief period of relative success as nomadic rune-traders, virtually unaffected by the Spellblaze.  The Spellhunt nearly proved to be their undoing, as their monstrous size and rune-covered skin made them popular targets; they were thought to be extinct, and only in recent years has the city of Elvala revealed that some Ogres took refuge there during this time.  Their descendants still live today, fearful of persecution but gradually beginning to explore outside Elvala for the first time in ages.

Ogres' most striking feature is their size, by far the largest of any intelligent race; they average at roughly 8'4" tall, and most are nearly half as wide with muscle.  They have a similar range of skin tones to humans, although slightly grayer on the whole; their hair tends to be dark brown or black, and their eyes run the gamut from black to bright blue to purple, presumably a side-effect of runic mis-transcription.  Their angular facial features invite some impolite comparisons to Orcs, with strong jawlines, disproportionately large mouths and teeth, and squarish heads, but otherwise resemble those of humans.  It would be remiss of me to describe Ogres' appearance without mentioning the intricate, glowing pattern of runes covering their skin from head to toe, although the exact patterns and colors vary.  

Although they excel at physical tasks for obvious reasons, and the necessity of careful inscription has made their finger dexterity (and penmanship) rather impressive, their limb movements tend to be slow and clumsy due to their size, and they tire quickly if they over-exert themselves during strenuous labor.  Their slow speech, incredible appetites, and lack of interest in arts or most scholarly concerns has led to a misconception that they are dim-witted; however, Ogres forced into studious tasks have performed admirably, and one needs only look at their runic patterns to know the patient study and artistic vision they are capable of, if properly motivated.  This may tie into the humble, duty-bound mindset that seems to be an inherent property of the species - most Ogres show absolutely no interest in leadership or impressing others, only completing tasks in the most reliable manner possible, and such strategies tend to be rather simple.

While Shalore use of magic is (arguably) a choice, Ogres have no such luxury.  Their inscriptions are as crucial to their well-being and structural integrity as any internal organ, and attempts by Ziguranth to "cleanse" captured Ogres of their runes invariably lead to them first collapsing under their own weight, then their organs shutting down one by one; one can assume that their natural infusions are just as vital.  As such, Ogre reproduction is a careful task; a newborn can live for a few months unaltered, but after this the parents must give their child a thorough regimen of runic inscription and herbal infusions.  The parents typically perform this task together, using each others' runes as a reference, and any mistakes made in the transcription will affect the child's health and development (usually adversely, though it is believed that transcription errors are responsible for mitigating Ogres' once-uncontrollable tempers).  As such, the inscribed patterns are as much of an influence on the child's development as the physical and mental traits of his or her parents.	

Due to the safety and comfort of Elvala, and their mistrust of much of the outside world, most Ogres who leave their home do so for trade purposes; no longer using Shaloren as couriers, some have begun to enter the growing market of runes and infusions, and have proven very successful thanks to their natural talent in this area.  Those few who could be considered "adventurers" tend to pack up their things and leave abruptly, not for glory or riches, but because they see a recurring source of misery in the world and wish to dispose of it themselves as a public service.  It is not uncommon for an Ogre to sigh in frustration after hearing about a hijacked shipment of grain, head out, return a few days later with the blood of a once-persistent bandit clan stuck to his club, and go right back to tending his crops.]], [[Ogres have never been a thriving race, starting from their abrupt appearance as soldiers and laborers for the Conclave during the Allure Wars (unexplained aside from a highly implausible story from the Conclave's Overseers about a lost mountain tribe).

They have a similar range of skin tones to humans, although slightly grayer on the whole; their hair tends to be dark brown or black, and their eyes run the gamut from black to bright blue to purple, presumably a side-effect of runic mis-transcription.  Their angular facial features invite some impolite comparisons to Orcs, with strong jawlines, disproportionately large mouths and teeth, and squarish heads, but otherwise resemble those of humans.  It would be remiss of me to describe Ogres' appearance without mentioning the intricate, glowing pattern of runes covering their skin from head to toe, although the exact patterns and colors vary.  

Although they excel at physical tasks for obvious reasons, and the necessity of careful inscription has made their finger dexterity (and penmanship) rather impressive, their limb movements tend to be slow and clumsy due to their size, and they tire quickly if they over-exert themselves during strenuous labor.  Their slow speech, incredible appetites, and lack of interest in arts or most scholarly concerns has led to a misconception that they are dim-witted; however, Ogres forced into studious tasks have performed admirably, and one needs only look at their runic patterns to know the patient study and artistic vision they are capable of, if properly motivated.  This may tie into the humble, duty-bound mindset that seems to be an inherent property of the species - most Ogres show absolutely no interest in leadership or impressing others, only completing tasks in the most reliable manner possible, and such strategies tend to be rather simple.

While Shalore use of magic is (arguably) a choice, Ogres have no such luxury.  Their inscriptions are as crucial to their well-being and structural integrity as any internal organ, and attempts by Ziguranth to "cleanse" captured Ogres of their runes invariably lead to them first collapsing under their own weight, then their organs shutting down one by one; one can assume that their natural infusions are just as vital.  As such, Ogre reproduction is a careful task; a newborn can live for a few months unaltered, but after this the parents must give their child a thorough regimen of runic inscription and herbal infusions.  The parents typically perform this task together, using each others' runes as a reference, and any mistakes made in the transcription will affect the child's health and development (usually adversely, though it is believed that transcription errors are responsible for mitigating Ogres' once-uncontrollable tempers).  As such, the inscribed patterns are as much of an influence on the child's development as the physical and mental traits of his or her parents.	

Due to the safety and comfort of Elvala, and their mistrust of much of the outside world, most Ogres who leave their home do so for trade purposes; no longer using Shaloren as couriers, some have begun to enter the growing market of runes and infusions, and have proven very successful thanks to their natural talent in this area.  Those few who could be considered "adventurers" tend to pack up their things and leave abruptly, not for glory or riches, but because they see a recurring source of misery in the world and wish to dispose of it themselves as a public service.  It is not uncommon for an Ogre to sigh in frustration after hearing about a hijacked shipment of grain, head out, return a few days later with the blood of a once-persistent bandit clan stuck to his club, and go right back to tending his crops.]], "_t")

Orcs were generally around 6'1", with green or black skin. They varied greatly in physical appearance and build, most likely due to their exceptionally fast breeding rates. The majority of orcs were thick-built and heavily muscled, well remembered as the stock grunts of their terrible armies. However in the Age of Pyre a greater number of thinner, stringier orcs appeared, oft versed in destructive magics.

The orcs were first encountered by the Eldoral halflings, who tried to use the simple creatures as servants, but gave up after finding them to be too violent. In the many centuries since wars and battles have been almost continuously fought with the brutes. Their oft superior numbers have at times threatened to overwhelm all of civilisation, even leading to such drastic defensive measures as the Spellblaze. The most terrifying time though was during the Age of Pyre, when the orcs developed arcane abilities, and under the leadership of Garkul the Devourer they swept through the continent, mercilessly slaying all before them. In the end 10,000 halflings gave up their lives in the Battle of Nargol to defeat their demonic leader and stem their army's advance. Gradually the civilised races began to recover, and finally King Toknor and Queen Mirvenia succeeded in uniting the human and halfling kingdoms, putting together a force to push back the orcs and ultimately extinguishing them entirely.

Recent investigations of orcish ruins have revealed a surprising amount of cultural material, and even crude artworks based around fertility and battle. Some evidence has also been found of strong community elements to their culture, with much focus on sporting activities and racial pride events.

There have been no substantiated reports of orcs for over 100 years.

t([[Ah, the legendary Sher'Tul! How any scholar does love to write about them. Indeed, the texts are many, but the facts are few, as so little is known about this crucible race. The most learned and factual academic on the subject is the renowned explorer and archaeologist Darwood Oakton, but he has alas been missing for several months at the time of writing. I will attempt to summarise here some of his key discoveries.

The Sher'Tul lived over ten thousand years ago, during what is referred to as the Age of Haze. The name of the race we know from the elves, who speak of the ancient beings with awe and reverence, yet know little else about them. Ruins of fantastical Sher'Tul structures have been found all across Maj'Eyal, and some have been observed in sunken lands off the coasts, implying that in their time the Sher'Tul must have ruled unopposed all across the world.

The farportals were first discovered by the halflings during the Age of Allure, and after much experimentation they were found to be able to transport items and creatures over vast distances. The arcane powers behind these incredible artifacts are still far beyond the understanding of the greatest minds of our time. The one attempt to truly tap into these powers ended in disaster - the Shaloren moved all known farportals to a remote spot near their capital, and their most powerful mages were overwhelmed as they unleashed the Spellblaze, killing them instantly and tearing apart the continent. What remains of farportals are left in the world have since been left untouched.

Of their physical appearance we know almost nothing, as there is no surviving artwork or records which depict themselves. However they must have been of similar form to other common races, as their ruins contain stairs, doorways and rooms not unfit for humans. Oakton estimates from his studies of their tools and artifacts that they would have stood around 5'4" tall, with uncommonly long limbs and fingers.

What caused them to become extinct is unknown, though many theories abound. The most popular in academic circles at the moment is that their mighty magics were their undoing, turned upon their own people during some great civil strife. Other theories hold weight though - Archiman Garybald, Professor of Demonic Studies, believes that the extensive uses of arcane energies by the Sher'Tul may have attracted twisted forces from other worlds which wiped out the ancient race. Some even believe that they are not truly extinct, but are in hiding, or have left this world for elsewhere. I fear the truth may never be fully known, but the ongoing study and examination of the relics they have left behind continues to provide immense value and inspiration.]], [[Ah, the legendary Sher'Tul!

t([[No text would be complete without at least a brief note of some of the more brutish races which infest our world. These do not hold any civilised society of note, nor in general do they seem capable of any form of higher thought or culture, but they are still of interest to study for any who take delight in analysing beings of more primitive intellect.

Trolls come in two main types - Kezrak and Moltep, or stone and forest trolls as they are colloquially known. Stone trolls infest many mountain chains to the north-east, and some have been known to wander further afield in search of food or to spread violence. They are generally over 8' high, with extremely pronounced muscular strength and a thick, solid hide which bears the appearance of coal or granite. Forest trolls are generally found in dense woods or swamps, with the Trollmire east of Derth being especially infamous. They have a more advanced form of speech than their mountain-dwelling cousins, and are known to move faster and wield more elaborate weapons, though their greenish hide is not as thick and their musculature less developed. All trolls have intensely fast metabolisms, capable of healing from grievous wounds within a matter of hours. At birth they measure just eight inches long, but within two years grow to full maturity, and rarely live beyond ten years old. They used to be considered little more than beasts, but towards the end of the Age of Pyre many were trained as fighters by the orcs, and were even taught the basics of language and certain battle tactics, making them much more dangerous. Though the orcs are gone their servants remain, and their remote breeding areas and intense birth rates have so far scampered attempts to eradicate them completely.

Giants live mostly around the mountainous peaks surrounding the Daikara Pass. They vary greatly in size, but are normally at least 10' tall. They look somewhat like large, deformed humans, with swollen or distended facial features and much longer, swinging limbs. They live in nomadic tribes, moving from peak to peak with the seasons, feeding on wild deer and goats. They are usually peaceful creatures, only turning violent when their territory is encroached or their young are threatened. There are sometimes reports of giants coming to lowlands and stealing farm animals or attacking communities, but these are rare and normally isolated to particularly harsh winters. Giants seem to have no developed culture or language worth mentioning, but have been noted to show interactions of limited intelligence and to commune well in groups.

Nagas were once believed to be mere myth, but reliable reports and even the capturing of dead physical samples has shown them to be real creatures. The upper half of their body is humanoid in form, with blonde hair and an extremely thin build, but the lower half is like that of a giant snake's tail. They stand around 6' tall on land, though their tails extend several feet further. They have been encountered off the eastern and south-eastern coasts of Maj'Eyal, which seems to indicate some exotic civilisation beneath the waves. Records of them exist only from the last few hundred years, and only more recently have they been interpreted as more than just the wild fantasies of inebriated sailors. They can breathe in air and underwater, possessing both lungs and gills, and have been reported to move with surprising speed on the ground. One might think them simply odd monsters, but they decorate themselves in jewellry and craft weapons and armour from materials found on the sea-bed, such as supple mail formed from layers of thick shark-hide. This would suggest an advanced culture, but communication with them so far has proved impossible. It is not known if they are capable of complex speech, but to date their only response to those who encounter them has been extreme violence, and fishermen in the east are always wary of coming across these vicious creatures.

The origin of Demons is not wholly known, but it is clear that they are capable of intelligence and so I feel the need to describe them somewhat here. It is known that they can be summoned by certain magical rites, and minor demons were oft in the employ of evil sorcerers during the Age of Dusk. The main theory, which is supported by certain studies by Shaloren archmages, seems to indicate that they come from another world than our own, with connections formed through intense arcane energies. It must be a truly terrifying place to host such foul denizens. Demons vary immensely in appearance and power, as much as the creatures of our own world vary. They generally have blueish blood and metallic flesh and skin, which can oft react oddly with our atmosphere - some become wreathed in flames, others release hideous acids or belching clouds of darkness. All seem versed in magical abilities to some degree, and the strongest of them possess truly terrifying powers. Luckily they are exceptionally rare, and seem to be much less common in modern times since magic has fallen out of use.]], [[No text would be complete without at least a brief note of some of the more brutish races which infest our world.

Dragons are incredibly long-lived creatures, with some known to survive for thousands of years. Though in their early life they are of a bestial nature, as they advance through the centuries they gain an ever keener and more developed intellect. The eldest of wyrms are sometimes considered the most subtle and intelligent of creatures in Maj'Eyal, capable of telepathic communication and advanced mental abilities, and wyrmics speak of them with the highest reverence.

Dragons come in many shapes and sizes, normally growing from 5' long hatchlings to 20' long mature drakes, with some of the greatest wyrms growing to over 40' in length. They are generally winged, with large lizard-like maws and sharp talons on both their fore and hind legs. They are often noted for the lustrous colour of their scales, normally representing an attunement to one of the key Elements of Eyal. This attunement is unseen in any other race, and some philosophers believe that dragons predate all other races, being formed as raw representations of the elements of nature at the beginning of the world. However this theory may be borne purely from the fanatical delusions of certain wyrmics who have studied the creatures for too long.

All corners of Maj'Eyal show some trace of different types of dragons. The Daikara Pass and surrounding mountain chains are home to a great number of ice and storm dragons. Numerous sand and red dragons can be found in the western desert and hills, and many have been the reports of gigantic sea dragons in the deepest oceans, especially to the south.

Attacks from dragons on humans and halfling settlements are fairly rare, but when they occur they can be truly devastating. Usually they are to feed on livestock, but now and then come attacks from newly matured drakes, seeking out precious metals and gemstones to build up a hoard. Dragon hoards have become a thing of legend, with the greatest wyrms rumoured to protect literal mountains of gold, but in modern times truly sizeable hoards are rare. The dwarves farmed hoarding dragons almost to extinction in the Age of Allure, and most dragons these days retain only modest treasures in their lairs.

Dragons are regularly hunted for their thick scales and their elementally imbued bones. Dragonskin leather is prized amongst armour-workers, as when properly treated it is both light and tough, and oft retains some inkling of the original wyrm's power. Dragon-bone is highly favoured by staff-crafters for its natural attunement to elemental forces, and is sometimes used by fletchers in the crafting of the most delicate yet resilient bows and arrows.

Hear me out on this.

Nowadays most don't really recognize how fascinating the world we live in truly is. It is vast, more than you can imagine. I can safely promise, any wild thought you can muster up, dear reader, will not come close to the truth. Such is the breadth of wonders, I would probably dismiss most of what I have seen as myth, be I not there myself. And even then sometimes, I had to wonder whether I could trust my eyes.

Perhaps I'm being too vague, or maybe these promises leave much to be desired. After all, adventuring is not all fun and exotics, it is before all danger and a constant threat of death, or worse. So then if you wish me to be more concrete, think of derelict, crumbling crypts, cults and demons, hungry forests full of monsters and forces beyond time and place. True, there is overwhelming awe, thrill even, but the reason that so little detail reaches you, is because so little live to tell.

So, a great hero is usually easy to recognize, being practically a walking history book. Clad in half the age of important events which he probably has no idea about.

It is important to remember, that every artifact has a meaning, beings of great power and importance behind them. Stories, that now slowly wane into nothing. This is why it is not artifacts that make an adventurer. It is his great deeds, the will to dare where nobody did before. It is not important if you get known in the process or not, after all, if you were truly great, maybe you will leave behind a legacy of your own.

The ultimate power of time - the ability to reset and try again if you fail, the ability to save time by seeing the results of investigations before they happen.

But trust me - "enough patience" is one nasty limiting reagent. You're going to be running out of that fast when you've spent the last week trying to dismantle an Age of Dusk-era house-of-cards system of causally interdependent tyrannies without causing dwarven extinction, and a plague just broke out right when you had things almost perfect, for the sixth time--

Look. The point is, there's a reason the person who writes the invitations and the mission statements isn't someone out in the field - and you're lucky enough to be working for someone who understands that you need more flexibility than idealism allows. Our squad knows that to stay sane, we have to know when "time flows forward at a rate of one second per second" isn't the only rule we have to break. That it's generally okay to skip the trial and just deal with a temporally hazardous jackass as you see fit, if you've foreseen a guilty verdict - as long as your investigations are solid when you actually conduct them (and you do have to do the work once in a while, or you'll only be capable of seeing yourself procrastinating). And if you just need to not be watched, you should know that there are a few decades in the Age of Dusk we and a few other squads recognize as "fair game" - whatever experiments you've wondered about or horrors you want to inflict, just keep it to the time period of infinite forgotten evils and it doesn't hurt anything in the grand scheme. Trust me, we've checked - nothing in that time period matters unless you've got another Spellblaze to set off.

But most importantly, you should know: Zemekkys is even lazier than I am, but he has status to maintain. If you continually violate his will, there will come a point at which you will be informed that you have been caught and should stop resisting. Accept whatever fate he doles out for you. If you do not stop, there will come a point where he will be forced to make an example of you so severe that the entire cosmos will notice your non-existence. Obviously we can't be sure how many of us he's done this to (if any) or how it works, but we're pretty sure that the result looks like something starting with a W.

Everyone here wants the same thing - keep spacetime stable, have fun with your powers, cheat at a few lotteries - but we've got cover to maintain and, in theory, an actual job to do if something ever cracks that Sher'Tul shield or the Greigu find a way to bypass a portal-filter. Scratch backs when yours gets scratched, don't make so much noise that the system comes crashing down on your head, and you'll enjoy your stay in eternity.

#{normal}#The Sher'Tul. Who were they? Where did they come from? Where did they go? The mysteries surrounding this ancient race are almost infinite. What little scraps of information we have regarding them allude to a mighty and world-spanning civilisation, wielding power and magic unthinkable. Now, however, all that remains of them are forgotten, wind-swept ruins, the tiniest minutiae of their technology sealed away in the studies of reclusive sages. Does their mystery not call to your curious nature as it does mine, gentle reader?

My quest has drawn me into the Old Forest. What is there to be said about a place like "the old forest"? It is a forest, and it is old. By its unimaginative moniker you can guess how important this place is to the people of Derth; the only locals who commonly venture under its boughs are novice alchemists in search of ingredients, plus the odd hunter with his sights set low. However, the story of this old forest now takes a more interesting twist...

Rumours are growing of trees roaming in its depths, moving as you or I would. Some even claim that they now possess the spark of sentience. The Sher'Tul were rumoured to hold the power of animism... is this mere coincidence?]], [[#{italic}#From the notes of Darwood Oakton, explorer:

He was from a small brood of no notable blood, but at a young age proved himself on the streets as a fierce and intelligent warrior. Note that there could be no one like Garkul in the other races. They coddle their nobility and weaken them, whilst those that endure true hardship are doomed to live a life of servitude. We orcs are all born equal, and every one of us is given the opportunity to fight and show our prowess above others. Only the strong live to rule, and only the smart stay in power.

Garkul formed his own street gang, as those who saw his strength quickly devoted themselves to him. Soon he became powerful enough to take over his whole tribe. But one day he was spotted for a greater fate. Verikor the spellmaker was visiting each tribe, gathering volunteers for his experiments in magic. When he came to Garkul's tribe the young orc laughed at him, and said that all the spells of Eyal could not match the muscles in his left arm. Verikor was impressed by this adolescent display of pride, and moreover saw something else in the youth, and invited Garkul to test his brawn against the strongest of the new breed of mages. Garkul accepted, and the two travelled to Verikor's halls.

Here Garkul was surprised, for the caverns beneath the halls hid thousands of orcs training in the ways of magic. They were highly organised, split into schools of ability and rising ranks, with masters teaching them well in the use of the Art for combat. Verikor explained how he had spent his life studying the effects of the Spellblaze, and experimenting on kidnapped mages from the other races, and this was the culmination of that lifelong research. With young orcs from all the tribes he could build an army of mages that could help their whole race fight back against their enemies. Garkul was clearly stirred by the possibilities this could bring.

Then came the time of the trial, for Garkul had bet that with his left arm alone he could fend off the greatest of wizards. So Verikor brought out his three most advanced students, one trained in fire, one trained in ice, and one trained in blood, and the challenge was to see who could knock the other out first. Garkul accepted with a grin, putting his right arm behind his back as he faced the three mages.

The pyromancer began by shooting a wreath of flames at the fighter, but Garkul dodged with immense speed, and before the mage could cast another spell Garkul was upon him, and swept a vicious uppercut into the caster's jaw, breaking it and instantly knocking him out. Then the cryomancer let loose a hail of ice, but Garkul grabbed the swooning fire mage by his robe and used him as a shield as he ran through the icy storm, till he came to the second caster, tossed aside the inert body, and hooked the ice mage soundly on the temple. With two mages down in just a few seconds he then turned on the corruptor, who backed off in fright. Garkul advanced with a laugh, but as he came near the blood mage cast a hex, and the warrior felt his arm suddenly shrivel up, unusable. With a curse he headbutted the final caster, who fell instantly to the ground, and the hex was broken.

Garkul turned to the amazed Verikor and bowed. "You have bested me - I had to use my head for the last one." But Verikor was in awe of the fighter's skills - his incredible speed, his amazing strength, and his quick-wittedness in battle were all far beyond anything he had seen before. The two talked a while, and Garkul brought forth many ideas for how the army of mages could work together with the warriors and the wilders of the tribes to produce an unequalled force. His eyes were open now to the potential for magic, and his brain wrought together new tactics and strategies for how it could be used in battle.

Verikor kept Garkul as his guest for many months, and though Garkul had no inkling for the Art he learnt many things about how to resist and avoid the effects of magic. Verikor never ceased to be impressed by the young orc's talents, and it became clear to him that here was one who was destined to lead their race to great things.]], [[#{bold}#Chapter One: A Young Warrior#{normal}#

The next spring Verikor brought Garkul to the tribal council, when each of the leaders of the tribes met. Wargon the elder headed the meeting, as they heard reports from the happenings in each tribe.

Garkul listened patiently until one of the western tribes briefed about an attack on their base by the halflings, and he stirred as he heard about how their warriors had fallen to the Eldoral slingers and mages, but Verikor bade him be still. There were mutterings from some of the other tribal leaders, but Garkul was shocked that none called for an avenging strike.

Wargon stayed silent and contemplative, but when the mutterings died down he raised his voice. "These are terrible events, but little can be done. To attack back would be to draw attention to ourselves, to invite further destruction. We must remain silent, perhaps-"

"Fangless dog!" shouted Garkul, standing up suddenly, no longer able to control himself. "You have no teeth! We should fight back, we should teach them a lesson for daring to assault our tribes!"

Wargon seethed with rage at the insult, and gestured for several guards to chop down the young warrior. Garkul tensed as he saw them reach for their weapons, ready to fight back against the whole room if needs be, but Verikor swiftly stood up to intervene. "Elder, forgive the boy; he is young and keen for battle. It is my fault for bringing him here, I accept full responsibility."

Wargon's eyes turned to slits as he looked at the spellmaker. "You would take this boy's stead?" Verikor gravely nodded, and a thin smile crossed the elder's lips. Long had he suspected the mage of building up secret forces, and now he saw a chance to remove a potential rival. He motioned to the nearest guard, who advanced on the unresisting mage and slit his throat.

Garkul remained motionless, staring hard at the elder. Wargon's slitted eyes rested on him for a moment, but the stare made him uneasy. Turning to one of the guards he said, "I do not like the look in this one's eyes. Put out his right eye, and then let him go." Garkul did not flinch as the guard took the knife to his face, and his left eye remained fixed on Wargon as the right was cut open and blood poured down his face.

He returned to his tribe and had the wound tended, but would accept no patch on it, and the name of Garkul One-Eye was laid on him. People asked, "How do you now intend to stand for leadership of our tribe when you have but half vision?" But Garkul responded, "I see more than all others, and I will lead this tribe and more besides."

He awaited his vengeance till he deemed the time right, and at the next tribal council he arrived with twenty of his followers. When he was refused entry he batted away the guards with a single swipe of his fist. He marched towards Wargon whilst his warriors surrounded the tribal leaders. "So, fangless wolf," he growled. "Will you fight me now?"

Wargon clenched his teeth, and not wanting to appear weak he reached for his daggers and sprung at the challenger. But Garkul grabbed both of his arms, and in a swift movement tore them from their sockets. Then he seized the screaming elder by the head, digging his nails into his flesh, and pulled the face close to his own. He opened his jaw over Wargon's right eye and bit down sharply, shearing the orb from its socket, before tossing back his head and swallowing the eyeball. Then he turned to the other eye and did the same, black blood running down his chin as he chewed through the squelching flesh.

He dropped the twitching body on the ground, bent over it and pummelled his fist down on the wounded head, cracking Wargon's skull apart and smashing out all his teeth. He turned then to the other leaders and cried, "See?! For each eye one takes from me, I take two! Follow me, and I will kill two halflings for every one they take of us. There will be no more snivelling and sneaking - we will rise up and bring a blaze of wrath across the lands!" Confronted by Garkul's strength and surrounded by his warriors, the tribal leaders without hesitation all agreed to follow him.

So ended the name Garkul One-Eye, for a new name was born: Garkul the Devourer. The teeth of Wargon he collected and made into a necklace, and he added more teeth to it as he dealt with dissent amongst the tribes, until all followed him without question.]], [[#{bold}#Chapter Two: Rise of the Devourer#{normal}#

- Sayings of Garkul the Devourer#{normal}#

Garkul united the tribes swiftly and effectively. He reorganised them, joining together the warriors and the wyrmics into their own bands, encouraging competition between them. Seeing the strength of the mages he split them in two, one for the elements, and one for corruption and death, and he encouraged them to compete against each other further. He said that only orcs could compete against other orcs, for the other races could never compare. Only through competition with ourselves could we achieve our true strengths.

He organised protective groups around the orcish territories, so that any attacks from the other races were quickly put down. But the halflings saw our increased organisation, and began to enlarge their scouting groups and bolster their patrols. Garkul saw that this could not continue any longer, and that the time was ripe to bring his plans to full fruition. He began to plan an attack on Barton, the largest Eldoral city in the region.

The attack was made in the dead of night. Under the shadow of darkness his army marched towards the city walls, and they were not spotted until they were nearly upon it. When the guards let up a cry of warning they tried to close the city gates, but the orcish mages let loose a barrage of spells that tore the defences apart. The Barton army finally rallied and began to flood out of the city gates to meet their attackers, but Garkul ordered that balls of fire be shot into their midst, splitting the troops apart, so that his fighters could easily slice through the few that came through the gates, whilst the archers shot down those held back by the flames. The pyromancers continued to send conflagrations of flame over the city walls, and as the halflings inside tried to escape their burning homes a new chaos erupted. For Garkul had sent necromancers into the city in advance through the sewers, and hidden by arcane illusion they now began to raise the fallen halflings as their undead minions. People screamed as they saw their deceased loved ones suddenly rise as ghasts and wights to attack them. And no leadership could be found amongst the defenders, as Garkul had sent through stealthed assassins to strike them down at the moment of attack. As all resistance crumbled the great leader then let loose his berserkers and wilders into the city, and they tore through the streets butchering every last opponent. Within a few hours not a single halfling remained alive, and not a single cobblestone in the city was left unstained by their crimson blood. And Garkul's victory was truly transcendent, for not a single orc had been hurt in all the battles.

When his troops asked what should be done next he stayed quiet for a moment, looking at a hill to the south of the city. Then he said, "Chop down wood from the forest nearby and bring it to the top of that hill. Then gather all the bodies from the city - every part of every man, woman and child - and construct atop the hill a mighty pyre." And his army did so, and did it quickly, for the word of Garkul now stood above all else in their minds. When the pyre was finished it was over 80 feet high, and crammed with the bodies of thousands of their victims. As dawn began to glow red on the eastern horizon they lit the pyre, and the flames rose up to make a mighty furnace, incinerating the fallen corpses.

The pyre could be seen for miles around, and the other races sent out scouts to find out what it was. Garkul instructed his troops not to stop them, and the reports came back to the leaders of the other races of a butchery beyond all concept. Some could barely believe the words of their scouts, but the next night the same happened again to another Eldoral city, and the night after several towns in the region were burnt to a cinder. Garkul's army was sweeping forth in a blaze of wrath, and suddenly the peaceful world of the other races was falling apart.

These early victories came easy, but as they advanced they met more resistance, as the races had more forewarning of their attacks. But Garkul was always master of any situation, and his strategy and tactics overcame all defences. And after each victory was always the great pyre, and our armies would chant songs of victory as the flames reached into the cold night sky. The battles would become known as the Pyre Wars, and the flames of conquest would spread across all of Maj'Eyal.

Within three months the Eldoral kingdom was broken, and refugees flooded south to the halfling kingdom of Nargol, desperate to escape the deadly pyres. Garkul then consolidated his forces, building new bases in the conquered lands, before advancing out against the other races. None would escape the wrath of the people that had suffered so long from the attacks of the other races. Centuries of oppression had hardened us, and now the flames of vengeance that rose in our hearts could not be quenched.]], [[#{bold}#Chapter Three: Bringer of Pyre#{normal}#

For many years the great conquest could not be held back. Garkul marched across the lands, insufferable of any resistance. The Eldoral were broken, and they fled to their halfling cousins the Nargols in the south. The humans were split into many kingdoms, and Garkul began to pick them off one by one, leaving just a few isolated in the west and south. The Thaloren hid in their dark forests, penned in by the mighty orcish armies. The Shaloren tried to fight, and with their great magics they created grave opposition to the orcish troops, but gradually they were beaten back and forced to retreat to their capital in the south-west. The dwarves viciously defended their halls in the east, and Garkul could not penetrate their cities of stone, but he laid plans in place to take them through caves below.

All the centre of Maj'Eyal was under Garkul's dominion - from the northern wastes to the southern lakes; from the Daikara Mountains to the western ocean. Orc patrols covered every valley and every field, and any enemies found were eradicated. Garkul's support was utterly unwavering, as every orc took new pride in their amazing achievements under his leadership.

But victory was not complete, as many centres of power and resistance still remained, and the Nargol were still a grave threat from the south. Garkul was careful not to overreach, not to spread his forces too thin before victory was assured. He knew he must bide his time and build up his forces to their greatest possible strength.

Then beneath the dwarven city of Reknor our scouts discovered an amazing thing - a Sher'Tul farportal. The blood mages studied it, and after some time they succeeded in activating it, and discovered a new land. It was the lost East, sundered from Maj'Eyal after the great cataclysm. Garkul saw here a great opportunity, and he instructed many thousands of young warriors and mages to be sent over to the east. There they formed training grounds where the military could train and practise to master their techniques before returning to join the wars in the west. Garkul named them the Prides, for he said here was were the strength of our race would lie, and here was what we would be most proud of.

But while Garkul was busy establishing the Prides the Nargol king was planning a strategy of defence. He knew that the orcish armies would come for his kingdom soon, and he drew on the powers of his greatest strategists to prepare a force that could not be overcome. He summoned the mightiest alchemists from all the lands and together they laid plans for a creation that could not be beaten: the giant golem Atamathon.

When Garkul next returned from the east he heard from his spies of great operations afoot in the Nargol kingdom, and he knew that he must face down the halflings. He did not know that it would be his last battle.]], [[#{bold}#Chapter Four: Conqueror of West and East#{normal}#

The blood mages studied it, and after some time they succeeded in activating it, and discovered a new land. It was the lost East, sundered from Maj'Eyal after the great cataclysm. Garkul saw here a great opportunity, and he instructed many thousands of young warriors and mages to be sent over to the east. There they formed training grounds where the military could train and practise to master their techniques before returning to join the wars in the west. Garkul named them the Prides, for he said here was were the strength of our race would lie, and here was what we would be most proud of.

But while Garkul was busy establishing the Prides the Nargol king was planning a strategy of defence. He knew that the orcish armies would come for his kingdom soon, and he drew on the powers of his greatest strategists to prepare a force that could not be overcome. He summoned the mightiest alchemists from all the lands and together they laid plans for a creation that could not be beaten: the giant golem Atamathon.

When Garkul next returned from the east he heard from his spies of great operations afoot in the Nargol kingdom, and he knew that he must face down the halflings. He did not know that it would be his last battle.]], "_t")

- Sayings of Garkul the Devourer#{normal}#

Garkul gathered a force together to take on the Nargol kingdom, striking south at their centre of power. It was not a force as strong as he would have liked, for many troops had been sent east to establish the Prides, but he knew he must quell any resistance from the halflings before it was too late.

He marched with care towards the southern city, with minor skirmishes along the way. As he approached the capital he saw the halfling armies ready, with over ten thousand troops organised into units, ready to defend their kingdom. Garkul had only five thousand with him, but he knew that his warriors were far stronger, and that with his tactics they would easily prevail. But still a nervousness was in him, and he advanced his troops with caution.

The orcs reached a tilled field, and the halfling army stood on the other side, waiting. Garkul eyed the ground suspiciously, but as the halfling slingers began to fire at them he knew he must act - he gave the order to attack. His warriors charged with speed towards with enemy, with his mages following behind, but as they neared their foe there was a sudden tumult in the ground. The fighters were knocked back as the earth tore open and a massive hand rose up, followed by a gigantic head. Slowly rising forth from the ground they saw a monster of unparalleled size - it was the giant golem Atamathon. Long had the halfling alchemists worked on it in secret, crafting its body of marble and its joints of voratun, setting a thousand rubies into each of its eyes and imbuing it with unrivalled power. Carefully had the strategists laid the trap, leading Garkul's army to this place with precisely timed skirmishes, waiting for the right moment to reveal their awe-inspiring weapon.

The orcish troops flailed against the golem, battering their weapons against its solid feet, but to no result. The mages fired spells of fire and ice at its chest, but they were reflected away without effect. Then the halfling alchemists stood forth and channelled their energies through the golem, and its ruby eyes glowed brightly before a beam of flames erupted and burned down on the orcish troops. The golem marched forwards, each step crushing dozens of warriors, whilst its beaming eyes tore through the ranks of mages. Then the alchemists joined in throwing bombs, and the slingers fired shot after shot and a great massacre began.

Garkul saw his troops in disarray, and knew that against this new weapon none of his army could prevail. He ran to his wolf-riders and grabbed the greatest beast, a vicious warg over ten feet long, and mounting it he charged into the fray. He rushed the wolf straight towards the giant golem, and made it leap towards the monster's towering chest. The golem swiped down a massive fist that smashed the warg apart, but Garkul jumped at the last moment and grabbed onto the golem's head, and drawing out his axe he swept it into one of the ruby eyes, shattering it.

Then the golem reached with both hands and grabbed Garkul by the arms, and his axe fell to the ground below. Atamathon held tightly to the great orc's limbs in its marble grip, and proceeded to try and rip them off. But Garkul flexed his muscles with all his strength, and resisted the might of the golem, and slowly he began to twist the golem's fists forwards, drawing him closer to monster's head. When he was close enough to that marble brow he smashed his head forwards against it, and the ringing sound of his steel helm hitting the solid stone tore through the air. The golem shuddered a moment, and Garkul headbutted it again, and his steel helm was torn from his pate. Once more he thrust his head forward, and the impact made a deep gash across his temples, but the thick marble of the golem's head was also dented. Another headbutt was launched forth, and two more as the golem's skull began to crack apart and its legs gave way beneath it. Garkul turned his bloodied head to the sky and roared before delivering a final fatal plunge of his head. His brow met the thick marble, and the golem's head shattered apart beneath the force. The golem collapsed, and Garkul with it. Thus fell the giant golem Atamathon, and its like has not been seen again.

At this the halflings were dismayed, for though the orcish troops were decimated their mighty weapon was also broken. Then they advanced towards the ruins and saw movement within, and before them rose Garkul the Devourer. His head was gashed and bloodied, and his arms were badly bruised, but he had recovered his axe and now faced them with a grin.

He saw he was alone now, for what had remained of his army had been finished off whilst he had battled the golem, and though they had fought well there still remained ten thousand troops before him. But he grinned, for he was a warrior true, and never more happy than when on the battlefield, facing foes insurmountable. He charged.

The bodies soon piled up in his wake as he tore through the halfling troops. He shrugged off blows against him, and swung his axe before him. He cleaved through skulls and sliced through armour and flesh and bones. When they tried to grab his weapon from him he punched them away, or bit through their throats. He laughed as he danced around his enemies, blood spurting up from their wounds and raining down over his face. Hundreds fell beneath his blade before the axe cracked and broke, but still he gripped the shaft and stabbed and clubbed and swiped.

Then the alchemists threw their bombs at him, scorching his flesh. And the archers and slingers fired at him, their arrows piercing his skin and their shots bruising his body. But Garkul roared a mighty warshout, and the arrows and shots in the air were shattered, and the ground before him tore apart. He grabbed two waraxes from the bodies nearby and rushed towards his attackers, raining down blows on them with each hand. The halflings surrounded him, and attacks came from all sides, but he carried on fighting furiously.

But the fight could not carry on forever. A stab from a sword crippled his leg, and a blast from a bomb blinded his eye, and though he continued to battle, wading through the corpses around him, blood now seeped through cuts all over his body. The blades of the axes he wielded became cracked and dented, and he was left wielding the shafts as clubs. He swung them through the troops before him, until his movements slowed to a stop, and the alchemists rained down bomb after bomb until his charred corpse moved no more. So died Garkul the Devourer, though his body stayed upright even in death, clutching his weapons above his head, and standing atop a field of over ten thousand bodies. For when the halflings counted their numbers after, only a few hundred remained.

Our forces never full recovered from the loss of our great leader. The wars continued, but without his strategies failure became more frequent. Eventually the other races began to fight back, and we were driven from our homeland. But the spirit of Garkul remains with us all, and his lessons stay in our hearts and minds. One day we will return to the place of his birth, and the glory he began shall be completed - Maj'Eyal will be ours.]], [[#{bold}#Chapter Five: Fall of the Mighty#{normal}#

I have begun work on several of the females. They are being kept in a coma for the duration of the experiments - it's far better that way. Initially I have subjected them to very high levels of wild infusion and arcane regeneration fields, whilst also keeping a direct feed into their stomachs high in protein. Corrupted blood is being pumped into their ovaries with a temporal acceleration field surrounding them. The leaders of each Pride have donated their seed for use in the experiments.

Initial results have mostly been immensely successful. Body mass has grown significantly, especially in the abdominal region. One has even begun developing extra ovaries and sexual organs. I have managed to increase their fertility immensely, and the stimulated foetal growth rate means that new orcs take only eight weeks from conception to birth. The young also seem to be progressing in their development at a very advanced pace, with particularly accelerated muscle development.

My work is continuing with tremendous success. All subjects now have multiple operational wombs, thanks to the corrupted blood infusions coupled with arcane regeneration fields to quickly repair the corrupted tissues. With greater advances in accelerating the foetal growth stage we are now seeing new orcs every few days! I believe this can be pushed even further.

Though the wombs operate at an advanced rate, we are keeping their vital organs suppressed to extend their lifespans. Perhaps they can live for hundreds, if not thousands of years.

Pumping nutrients directly into their stomach is proving a difficulty with the increased activity in the abdominal region.

How glad you must be to hear from your "renegade" son. Do not worry overmuch; I keep myself and my group well hidden from your petty Council. I know how you fret about your status amongst those fools.

I write to you to tell you that I have discovered something wonderful. In all my travels I could not have imagined a place so perfect as this. It is a remnant of the Great Spellblaze, a scar in the very fabric of Eyal. How beautiful it is! Ah, and what strength lies here too! You cannot possibly imagine, sitting idly in your little hall of stone.

You ramble on about the destruction it caused, but I cannot help but think you are exaggerating about the deaths. And were not the orcs also defeated? The grand purpose was achieved. Oh, you prattle about the plagues and blights, but I have seen how those dirty humans live, and those halflings in their grimy holes. Pestilence is rife amongst them.

The Spellblaze is almost complete; it only needs our gentle push to bring everything to full fruition. The walls between worlds have been worn thin here, and with my strength we can break through to realms of power beyond belief. Such power I shall have! And with it I shall rend forces through this broken world that shall make the Spellblaze seem a happy memory. Eyal will be put to right, and our mighty place restored at the head of all other races! For the Rhaloren this shall truly be the Age of Ascendancy. For the lesser races, herewith comes their Age of Torment.

* Unnatural or "elven" beauty
* Extreme thinness, with prominent bones

* Hunched backs and distorting limps

* Social aversion and fear of crowded places
* A questioning and probing attitude, in particular if challenging the precepts and set morals of society
* Quick-wittedness, especially where used for guile
* Furtiveness or a secretive attitude

In their effect on their environment you should be wary of the following:
* Causing grass to wilt and flowers to close as they pass
* Animals are alarmed by their presence, particularly dogs
* Crops wilt and cows' milk turns sour
* Arguments are stirred within their presence
* Women's moontide flow becomes more effluent
* Apparitions and unexplained events occur in their surroundings

Too long has Eyal suffered the torture of their presence, and so we must fight with all the powers that nature can give us.

Mobility is key against spell-slinging warlocks and witches. One must rush with full speed towards them and hack them down, not giving them time to utter a spell of attack or defence. Against multiple opponents this could be difficult, and retreat to less open space is often vital.

Necromancers and fell conjurers can present a great threat when they summon their dark minions to overwhelm you. Oft it is best to take out the wizard first, though it presents risk. You must raise your will and suppress all pain until you come right upon him, and then strike him down quickly before retreating to a safer area. Stunning or dazing the caster before they have a chance to summon aid can also help immensely.

t([[When a magic-user is captured, they must be slain, and slain fast. Captivity is too great a risk. Preferably they should be killed in a way that utterly removes any means for the body to recover through arcane force. Remember that coming back from the dead is no alien feat to these abominations.

Beheading is simple and effective, especially in a hurry, but ideally their other limbs should be removed too and sealed in separate metal cases wrapped in willow-bark.

Devouring by animals is sometimes used, but is not advised, as it can at the very least can cause severe diarrhoea in the animals, and at the worst can leave you facing a pack of fire-breathing hell hounds corrupted by the mana-wielder's aura.

Freezing is ineffective, and no magic-user can ever be frozen to death, in spite of what rumours you may have heard. Anyone you have heard of that was frozen to death was either not a mage or was pretending.

Burning is popular amongst the less educated towns, but typically no witch or wizard of power would ever allow themselves to be caught, bound and put to stake without finding means of escape. Simply putting together the necessary firewood takes too long, even if stocked in advance. Usually those executed in this manner are magic-sympathisers rather than true magic users. Whilst strictly speaking this does not carry the penalty of death it does well to set an example for others and to warn arcane users to stay well away from the community.

The best method, if time and situation allows, is to very slowly slice the caster to death. One should have them securely bound in a sealed room, with willow-bark or beech-wood around their wrists and cranium. One should start by slowly slicing off the toes, fingers and other extremities, before slicing through all the limbs and finally the torso. Do not cut open the skull, in case resident demons escape. The head should be put into a metal box and incinerated for 24 hours with the rest of the remains. Extremely sharp instruments are needed for the job, and do not be surprised if they need re-sharpening several times during the process, as it is a typical warlock's trick to harden their bones before the procedure as a final act of spite.

I am truly sorry about this; had circumstances been different, we could've been allies, my weapons and magic letting you fight the hordes of threats to Maj'Eyal.  As it stands, however, your continued existence is highly inconvenient to me.

See, my funding comes from the merchants of Last Hope, who want a functioning portal and will stop paying once they have one; furthermore, my portal research has proved to be a very useful cover story for the other experiments I'm conducting here.  Now that you've gotten a portal working, and will want to use it in full view of the city, I'm out of a job - and there is so much more knowledge for me to find!  The medical applications of necromancy, for one - the only other source of data on this subject went missing shortly after her husband's death, and everyone else has a Ziguranth-like fervor against the idea of using that magic baseline in any way whatsoever.  Also, selective drake breeding programs, experiments on zealots to shatter their anti-magic barriers, studying demons to learn more about their altered biologies and steal that magic for our own militaries...  I could go on, but I'd rather not waste enchanted ink.  The point is, you using the portal without further injury would mean an end to my experiments.  Ideally, you need to disappear, but if you were to emerge from my basement, wounded and raving with wild eyes about impossible beasts in the basement of my humble tower...  well, that'd just further my case that portals need more research to be used safely, wouldn't it?

#{italic}#As you move on to the next paragraph, you notice that everything above it has faded away, and the scroll is beginning to grow warm in your hands.#{normal}#

Worry not, though - you can still help the world, by devoting yourself to my quest for knowledge!  My sources have told me that you've grown exponentially more powerful since you first started making a name for yourself, and you continue to cause prodigious amounts of destruction.  The modified portal I used on you had about a 33% chance of draining some of the power you've accumulated; if you're feeling exhausted, simply lay down and wait for my imp servants to collect you for further testing.  If you aren't, however: I've sealed the way up, and placed the switches in each of the subject holding pens on this floor.  You can fight your way through them, and I'll be watching to see how a creature of your power fares against different types of foes.  I'm sure you'll want to get to the top floor and kill me in revenge, and I encourage you to try!  You may die, but the data you provide will be immortal - and if I can have my drolem subdue you non-lethally, I'll send you back to the bottom and repeat the experiment with tweaked parameters.  We can keep repeating this until I find your breaking point, or figure out what makes you so special, at which point you'll be held until I can work on a reliable method of controlling your mind.  And on the off chance that you do actually manage to kill me...  try not to do too much damage to my notes, please?  Knowledge and progress are bigger matters than either of us; don't let your spite doom thousands of lives that could rely on my research in the future.

Oh, and I can't risk this note getting into anyone else's hands, can I?  It's going to catch fire a few seconds after you're done reading.  Please drop it before it does - you having burnt hands isn't part of the experiment.

t([[Well...  that was interesting.

Setting up a portal took surprisingly little effort - conjured replicas of a Blood-Runed Athame and a Resonating Diamond work perfectly for setting up a portal, as it turns out, even if it burns them out after making just one.  This solution wouldn't work for the Orb of Many Ways, given that if it shorts out after one use, that means you're trapped on the other side of the portal, so I started working on a more tangible replica.  I noticed that most of them were disrupted by some form of interference, maybe echoes from the Spellblaze; my latest attempt at a more permanent orb was more of a curiosity than anything, an attempt to use those waves as constructive interference to lock onto their source.  I tossed a bandit through (my drolem's flight and relative silence have proven to be very convenient for securing test subjects!) with it tied to him, expecting him to pop into some magical maelstrom, quickly teleport back, and promptly die of terrible burn wounds (like the last four).

I didn't get a bandit back.  I got an imp.

My drolem grabbed it with its jaws, as usual, but I told it to back off on seeing the imp wasn't armed and wasn't even trying to cast any spells.  I apologized, treated its wounds, then asked it to explain what happened to my test subject.  Apparently, the demons have been running their own portal experiments!  The test subject was unharmed when he popped up in their laboratory; after the demons "questioned" him (boiling tar was involved), they realized that another inquisitive mind was on the other side, and hoped to communicate and possibly trade data with that person.  I've managed to make more progress than the demons have - either I'm a genius, or I've severely overestimated the threat the demons pose!

I've "officially" agreed to their deal - they'll supply me with materials, subjects, and what little progress they've made, and in return I've developed a modified orb that'll give them readings when it's used in a portal.  Needless to say, the readings are all bogus, and if they actually try to use those readings to make a second portal of their own, it'll blow them to bits.  The data they've given me has been VERY useful!  I've used it to construct a second altar from scratch - it still has some links to the demonic realm, but a single teleport with a genuine Orb of Many Ways will recalibrate it and cut those off completely, letting me get away scot-free with my knowledge and treasures, and preventing the demons from reaching me again.

t([[We live in a world of wonders. All around us are natural energies and wild powers that are a marvel to see and experience. Soaring birds, mighty bears and ice-breathing dragons all abound in towering mountains, deep oceans and luscious forests. And we are part of this glorious environment, with our thoughts and strengths and all our wondrous capabilities. Truly we live in a fantastic world, and we should be glad to have a place amongst the wonders of Maj'Eyal.

But some are not content. Some seek to pervert the wonders of the world with unnatural powers. With arcane forces they rip the threads of nature apart and sew it back however they see fit, uncaring of the damage they cause. Sometimes it is out of curiosity or a misplaced desire to do good, but normally it is out of greed and malice and a perverse obsession with power. Even those who enter into the banes of magic with good intentions inevitably end up doing harm and becoming themselves corrupted by the gross forces they tamper in.

History teaches us well the dangers of these forces. First were the Sher'Tul, of which we know little, but we do know that they manipulated magic to strengths beyond the dreams of current mages. And they led themselves to their own utter destruction. Alas that the lesson was not learnt by the younger races. The first recorded war in our history is between the humans and halflings for control of Sher'Tul ruins. Magic was used in those wars and the battles only stopped after two thousand years of slaughter left both sides too crippled to carry on fighting. It was in this time that our order was formed, and we tried to stop the insanity and the bloodshed. Alas that we failed.

The weakening of our peoples by the magic-fuelled fighting left us then open to attacks by the orcs, whose surging numbers nearly overwhelmed us. But instead of relying on our own strengths and our natural defences, the foolish elves decided that only the arcane forces could save us. How very wrong they were... Their insidious mages tapped the vile powers of the Sher'Tul ruins and unleashed catastrophic waves of energy that burned half the world to a cinder. Mountains crumbled, lakes were boiled, and raging fires stripped the land of all life. The devastation can truly never be fully stated. But it is unforgettable and utterly unforgiveable. The Shaloren try to deny responsibility, but the blood of millions is on their hands.

The suffering that followed the unfortunate survivors lasted centuries, as the unnatural forces created black plagues that wiped out kingdoms and made huge swathes of land uninhabitable. Dread warlocks and necromancers took advantage of the chaos to raise armies and gain power. Kor'Pul was the deadliest of these, and our order fought long and hard to kill him time and time again. We fought viciously to protect the people of Maj'Eyal from all the terrible pains of this time.

But our efforts could not prevent the ultimate tragedy that followed. The plagues were mere echoes of the Spellblaze as its horrible effects rebounded across the land. One dark and terrible day those echoes rose in resonance, and a cataclysmic force tore through the heart of our world. The land was rent in two, earthquakes spouted forth magma from the ground, and the eastern edge of our land was torn away and sunk into the deepest oceans. It was a tragedy beyond comparison.

As our civilisations slowly recovered the orcs began to increase in numbers, and it became clear then that they too had learned the dark arts. For centuries we suffered their attacks, and only by a unification of the races did we manage to finally contain them and wipe them out. Our order was vital in suppressing their pyromancers and blood mages, and many of our people bravely gave up their lives to protect the western armies and towns from destruction.

But we are not clear of danger yet. Magic still exists, though oft it lies secret and hidden. Memories of the dark days have waned, and one can even see alchemists and enchanters walking openly in the streets, unheeding of the pain their ilk have brought to our world. But worse exists... Secret societies hide themselves in unknown places, plotting and scheming to bring further destruction on Maj'Eyal. Dark cults exist in quiet isolation, kidnapping innocents and performing vile ceremonies. We try our best to hunt these monsters down, to root them out from their fell dens and bring an end to their depraved plans. Yet we must try harder, for our world is in mortal peril if these fiends are allowed to act unhindered.

We must never forget the terrors of the Great Evil, and the suffering brought upon us by those who choose to corrupt nature with arcane powers. Be wary in your travels, and be thorough in your duties. Our fight is difficult, but it is just and true, and not until all Maj'Eyal is cleansed of the impurities of magic can we ever know peace. We are the protectors of the world, and by our strength and our union with nature we shall be its saviours.

Dread warlocks and necromancers took advantage of the chaos to raise armies and gain power. Kor'Pul was the deadliest of these, and our order fought long and hard to kill him time and time again. We fought viciously to protect the people of Maj'Eyal from all the terrible pains of this time.

But our efforts could not prevent the ultimate tragedy that followed. The plagues were mere echoes of the Spellblaze as its horrible effects rebounded across the land. One dark and terrible day those echoes rose in resonance, and a cataclysmic force tore through the heart of our world. The land was rent in two, earthquakes spouted forth magma from the ground, and the eastern edge of our land was torn away and sunk into the deepest oceans. It was a tragedy beyond comparison.

As our civilisations slowly recovered the orcs began to increase in numbers, and it became clear then that they too had learned the dark arts. For centuries we suffered their attacks, and only by a unification of the races did we manage to finally contain them and wipe them out. Our order was vital in suppressing their pyromancers and blood mages, and many of our people bravely gave up their lives to protect the western armies and towns from destruction.

But we are not clear of danger yet. Magic still exists, though oft it lies secret and hidden. Memories of the dark days have waned, and one can even see alchemists and enchanters walking openly in the streets, unheeding of the pain their ilk have brought to our world. But worse exists... Secret societies hide themselves in unknown places, plotting and scheming to bring further destruction on Maj'Eyal. Dark cults exist in quiet isolation, kidnapping innocents and performing vile ceremonies. We try our best to hunt these monsters down, to root them out from their fell dens and bring an end to their depraved plans. Yet we must try harder, for our world is in mortal peril if these fiends are allowed to act unhindered.

We must never forget the terrors of the Great Evil, and the suffering brought upon us by those who choose to corrupt nature with arcane powers. Be wary in your travels, and be thorough in your duties. Our fight is difficult, but it is just and true, and not until all Maj'Eyal is cleansed of the impurities of magic can we ever know peace. We are the protectors of the world, and by our strength and our union with nature we shall be its saviours.

t([[I used to be a potion merchant in Derth. I brewed alchemical tonics and elixirs for locals and travellers. My trade was good, and I lived very happily from the gold I earned. For a young woman to have such a business I was very proud.

One day however several people in the town fell ill from a mystery disease. Rumours spread that my potions were to blame, and people stopped coming to my shop. My business was in ruins, and I soon ran the risk of becoming destitute. Then one of the elders died, and though he had been ill for some time, I was blamed for his death. People said I had laid a hex on him, and murmurs arose of witchcraft.

I still remember how peaceful the evening had seemed when the townsfolk came for me. I was looking up at the brightness of the stars and the clear crescent Summertide moon, thinking of how I should restart my business, when I heard shouts from the distance. I saw the crowd appear from round the corner, advancing with their torches. I screamed for help, but they broke through my door, smashed through my windows and grabbed me. They dragged me outside and set their torches to my house. I was stripped to my skin and beaten heavily whilst they cursed and jeered, and even the man who had been my fiancé spat on my face and cursed me.

They pulled me over grass and stone to the town square, and though half-blinded by the tears and my swollen flesh I could still make out the wooden stake they were erecting. I tried to cry out, I tried to beg for mercy, but their response was to hold me down by my throat and pull out my tongue with the blacksmith's tongs. As I coughed up blood they put me against the wooden pole and used barbed cords to tie my wrists to it above my head. The pain was unbearable and I passed out, and did not wake until I could feel the burning at my feet. The crowd were cheering as the smoke began to wrap around me, and they cheered louder with every pained scream I released from my lungs.

I was choking from the smoke, barely able to breathe, and I could no longer feel my legs. Just when I felt my consciousness slipping away again I heard a commotion and a woman's voice shouted out, "She is no witch!" Then I saw some people coming towards me, and at the front was a halfling woman in dark armour. She rushed towards me, unheeding of the flames, and with a swift flick from her long sword she cut my bonds. She caught me as I fell and pulled me away from the fire, laying me down on the ground. I saw her soft face above mine as she whispered to me, "Tell me child, do you reject magic in all its forms?" I nodded my head - I could not say no to those bright eyes. She wiped the tears streaming down my face and kissed my forehead. "Then you will be safe - rest now." At once I passed out.

When I awoke I was in another village in a soft bed. There were wrappings round my legs and bandages covering the cuts and bruises over the rest of my body. Healers tended to me, using natural remedies and herbal balms. The halfling woman would come and see me every day to check up on me. I longed for her every visit. She would speak to me sometimes. She explained how the townsfolk weren't to blame for their actions. It was all the mages' fault. They were corrupting the world, spreading chaos, and turning people against each other. I realised I was wrong for ever brewing potions - they were infested with arcane energies and could only bring harm to the world.

She explained how she and her friends were helping to save the world, to rid our lands of all magic. And she has saved me. Not just from a terrible death, but also from the evil influences of the arcane. Even if I still had a tongue I could not find words to express my thanks to her, and my joy at the new life I lead, free from the abominations of magic. Thanks to her help I can now walk again with the aid of a crutch, and I can find true happiness in my rightful place in nature.

I have no voice now to tell my story to others, and so I write it down instead, and I spread it to the winds. I have suffered from my contact with magic, and others will suffer too. Do not trust in the terrible powers of these devious arts. They will only betray you and bring you to harm. Turn your back on magic, and make others repent too. Find your own salvation in nature's joys before it is too late.
