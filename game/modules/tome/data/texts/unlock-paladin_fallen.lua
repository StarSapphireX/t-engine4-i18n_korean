_t[[#{bold}##GOLD#You aren't so different...#LAST##{normal}#

As a sun paladin, you follow a code.  But with the darkness you've seen in the world, you've started to doubt.

You have unlocked the #LIGHT_GREEN#Fallen class evolution#WHITE# for Sun Paladins.

New Powers:#YELLOW#
- Dirges: A new set of songs that protect you from the world.
- Self-Hatred: Spend your life for bloody destructive power.
- Cursed Aura: Corrupt the items around you.
Altered class abilities:
- Bloodstained: Dash between enemies, stacking up damage over time.  You only stop when there's nothing left to kill!
- Black Sun: Crush enemies with powerful gravity attacks.
- Crimson Templar: Reflect damage to your enemies as their wounds grow worse and worse.
#WHITE#

Class evolutions are selected as prodigies and grant new ways to build and expand your class. They are only visible to the concerned class.
