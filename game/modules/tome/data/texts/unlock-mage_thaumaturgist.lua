return _t"New Class Evolution: #LIGHT_GREEN#High Thaumaturgist (Archmage)",
_t[[You have killed a boss by only using beam spells and nothing else, showing a deeper understanding of this type of spells.

You have unlocked the #LIGHT_GREEN#High Thaumaturgist class evolution#WHITE# for Archmages.

Features:
- #YELLOW#Wide Beams#WHITE#: Flame, Manathrust, Lightning, Pulverizing Auger and Ice Shards permanently become 3-wide beam spells.
- Access to the Thaumaturgy spell category containing the spells:
  - #YELLOW#Orb of Thaumaturgy#WHITE#: By placing a thaumaturgy orb on the ground you can duplicate all beam spells you cast.
  - #YELLOW#Multicaster#WHITE#: Casting beams becomes so easy for you that you can weave in random non-beam spells when you cast one.
  - #YELLOW#Slipstream#WHITE#: Flow through the battlefield with ease, when you cast a beam spell you can move one tile for free.
  - #YELLOW#Elemental Array Burst#WHITE#: The ultimate beam spell, the culmination of your deep understanding of magic. A 3-wide beam of pure thaumic energy that can never be resisted.


Class evolutions are selected as prodigies and grant new ways to build and expand you class and are only visible to the concerned class.
